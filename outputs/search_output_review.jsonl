As a rule, I still do not just drink a glass of alternative, becasue even though I use them for cereal and cooking, I do not find them to be very satisfying to drink straight up, not like a nice cup of real milk was to me! I ordered this carton of soy milk becasue they come in smaller packages, and sometimes I just want to use a little, and not risk letting the rest of a larger carton going bad if I don't finish it after opening. This just showed up on my doorstep today, right when I was making my morning coffee. I usually drink my coffee black, but since I knew I was going to do this review I figured I could also add it to my cup of joe and report back about that too. Well, I first opened it to deeply smell it, and it was quite pleasant, nothing offensive to it at all! So, I took a swig of it and wow, this milk tasted great!!! Almost better than any other soymilk I have ever tasted before! Really! So I then emptied out about 3/4 of this 6.42 oz package into my coffee and wow, It practically tasted like a regular creamer in my coffee... and it is sweet enough that I did not have to add any more sugar or sweetener. This drink was good enough like it is, but I can imagine adding other things like cinnamon, chocolate or vanilla, chai flavors, mint, and just about anything else to make it into a dessert type drink, using coffee or tea or nothing!!! I would give 5 stars just based on taste, but to me some of the ingredients take away from the nutritional goodness of what could be a totally healthy drink for those who can tolerate soy. The verdict might be out about HFCS, but I usually avoid anything with high fructose corn syrup in the added ingredients. (Sorry, but that is probably why this tastes so good and sweet, and I think a little bit of it now and then is not going to hurt me, much.) I really wished there was a different sweetener used in this, and no NOT stevia! It also has carrageenan in it, which doesn't agree with some person's systems.

There are sixteen 6.4 oz boxes with accompanying sealed plastic straws that can easily puncture the foil in its designated spot at the top of the TetraPak carton. The soy flavor is rich and bold while the drink finishes on a sweet note. It is silky smooth and has a creaminess to it that I really enjoyed. It didn't taste watered down like some other soy milks I have tried. I noticed my traditional milk drinking family really enjoyed this soymilk and drank it without any issues. It can be enjoyed either at room temperature or ice cold from the refrigerator. I found that I enjoyed it most when it was ice cold. There is a limited amount of information translated into English on the individual boxes. The nutritional information is posted on the product box that holds all sixteen boxes. In each single serving pack, there are 60 calories, 2g Total Fat, 7g Total Carbohydrate, and 4g Protein. There is 245.59mg Calcium in one box which is 24% of the Daily Value. The manufacturer did note that the product was manufactured in a facility that also processes milk, wheat, tree nuts (almond, brazil nut, cashew, pine nut, walnut), and peanut. If you have an allergy to any or all of these items, please be aware of this. The product is Made in South Korea. The product I received has a best by date of 7 months from the date I received it.

Well, this one apparently does. They took what could have been an outstanding, fully-ground soymilk, and turned it into a still very tasty, but overly processed drink. The taste itself is good, if a bit sweet. It's similar sweetness to those chocolate milk cartons, but didn't feel sugary at all and didn't spike my blood sugar (thanks to using mostly sucralose instead of corn syrup). It tastes like a rich, sweet soymilk with a slight hint of peanut flavor. The nutrition of these is good as well. With 60 calories, 4 grams fiber, 4 grams protein, 7g carbohydrates and only 4 grams added sugar - these are quite healthy. They also have 250mg calcium (added calcium) to make this kind of like a milk substitute. It gives a bit of a chalky taste - and personally I would seek out a variety without the added calcium, I'm not sure it's necessary to get 25% calcium in a tiny carton of soymilk. Overall - it tastes good and has good nutrition, but definitely has more ingredients than I would like. That being said - it is healthier than most soy milks out there, and I'm sure most kids would love the taste.

It doesn't matter that much to my husband, because he only really uses it as an ingredient in things, since he has never been a big milk drinker.  I, on the other hand, used to drink milk as my primary beverage and loved it with pretty much every meal.  I really miss it.  So, I have tried pretty much every unsweetened milk alternative I could get my hands on -- you name it, I've almost certainly tried it (soy, almond, coconut, hemp, oat, hazelnut, blends thereof, etc. etc.).  I had never come across macadamia milk before, though.  So, when I saw it on sale for Prime Day, I jumped on it, even though it was a 6-pack.  It sounded pretty good, since I'm a fan of macadamias.  Plus, I figured it had good potential for milk, since they're such a creamy nut to begin with. And wow -- no regrets.  This milk is so rich and smooth, with none of that \"off\" aftertaste that most milk alternatives have.  It still isn't dairy -- so don't go in expecting that.  But that said, it is the closest I have ever come to finding a true milk replacement.  This is actually enjoyable to just drink by the glass or with a meal.  In particular, it's not too thin, and it doesn't have an overly distinctive, in-your-face kind of flavor.  It's neutral and goes well with almost anything, which is what I always loved about cow's milk.

I quite like this macadamia nut milk.  Maybe three years ago, I gave up all dairy and eggs for a bit over a year because I'm not comfortable with how animals are treated in factory farms.  During that period, I used soy and almond milks, but I ended up going back to milk (trying to find the most humane brands offered in my area) because I just didn't feel good physically.  A couple of years later, I'm now suspecting that I've developed a lactose intolerance as I've gotten older, so I started looking for alternatives and found this. When I use this on cereal, I really don't notice a difference between it and milk.  I think it's great on cereal.  Yes, it definitely tastes different than milk, but the cereal masks that for me.  When drinking it straight, I think it's at least as good as soy or almond milk...which means that I don't think it's awesome, but it's not bad at all. The containers are very convenient.  You don't need to refrigerate this until you open one, although I do keep mine in the refrigerator so that they're already cold when I want to open a new one. No question, I wish that the price was lower.  At the moment, it's a bit more than twice as expensive as the milk that I was buying, which is already over twice as expensive as regular milk...so, this stuff isn't cheap.

It's unsweetened and has a tiny amount of salt, but doesn't taste salty. Among shelf-stable/tetrapak varieties (rather than fresh/refrigerated) soy milks, it's pretty good. It has a clean, unprocessed taste and a slightly powdery but still pleasantly smooth finish or mouthfeel.  I like that it's unsweetened, because most pre-sweetened soy milks are much too sweet.  It's made in South Korea. The full ingredients are: soymilk (water, soybean), refined salt, roasted brown rice powder, calcium carbonate, black soybean extract Though I like the flavor, one thing I don't like as much is that there's no indication that the soy is non-GMO, which means it's probably made with genetically modified soybeans.

However, given my desire to switch to more sustainable and humane options, EdenSoy's soymilk is a great option. By virtue of being soymilk, it's an A+ on the animal cruelty scale by being plant-based, sources its soybeans from US farms + buying directly from farmers (rated highly by the Cornucopia Institute and has been quite transparent, unlike Silk and similar brands), and seems to be incredibly nutritious (compared to competing brands) even without additives / fortification! I will admit, I've never tried it plain since I always drink milk in shakes, but it seems to have no beany smell / taste compared to similar brands, and after making my own soymilk at home was a disaster, I caved and just bought 10 boxes of EdenSoy milk. Definitely a product my tastebuds and values are proud to support. I heard Silk threatened to stop buying from some of the US farmers unless they matched the imported Chinese bean price (and they claimed to stop but unsure of third-party verification), so I'd rather pay more to support fair prices for US farmers (for both the economic and environmental aspect of it). Will probably do more research to determine whether it's worth continuing to purchase this product or not, but for now it's good!

It has exceeded my expectations in every way and so far I absolutely love it.  Not only does this oven look great on the counter, it doesn\u2019t take up too much space, and the versatility of this oven is amazing.  And the new industrial design is timeless and will fit in with any style. A true oven, I think people who bought the slightly smaller Smart Oven Pro like I did, found that it can actually replace their large oven for cooking a lot of items.  This is really a true oven that can cook anything that your main oven can, even a 14lb turkey, but with more efficiency.  The interior of this oven is huge, measuring 16 inches wide by 12 inches deep, and 7 inches high, giving you more room for tall loafs of bread or cooking roasts without grazing the top elements.  There\u2019s one extra element on top, making 6 quartz elements in total.  The 8 rack positions offer a range of heights for cooking a variety of different sized foods, and will easily fit a large dutch oven. The range of functions on this model makes it much more versatile than the Smart Oven Pro, now with 13 different modes.  In addition to the 10 modes found on the Pro, the Air adds nifty features such as a proofing mode, giving you a proper way to rise dough for perfect baking results.  They\u2019ve also added a dehydration feature, letting you dehydrate a variety of foods such as fruit snacks or beef jerky, and lets you dehydrate up to four trays at a time.  The new Super Convection mode boosts the fan speed enabling crisper results and faster cooking speed than ever before, and I\u2019ve had nothing but good results so far. Most interesting is the Air Frying mode.  Not only does this eliminate the need for a separate appliance, this is a great way to cook frozen snack foods like fries and onion rings, evenly browning and crisping perfectly. Baking in this oven is precise and yields consistent results.  Cookies came out evenly browned all around.  I roasted a chicken that came out amazing, using the new phase cook feature. Phase Cook allows you to set two back-to-back cooking functions, so you can for example quickly crisp and brown the outside of a roast and automatically switch to a lower, slower cooking method for the remainder of the time.  This is one of my favourite features, and makes it possible to achieve incredible results with little effort.  Also new, is a Rotate reminder, that alerts you half way through to turn the pan around for the best most even results.  I really found that helpful, especially for times when I\u2019m using two racks at once. With all the baking and roasting this oven does, it\u2019s easy to forget that it also functions as a 9 slice toaster!  This oven puts heat exactly where it\u2019s needed, providing the most even toasting I\u2019ve seen.  Bagels were browned on top while the bottoms remained soft and lightly toasted.  And if you just finished toasting a bagel or making toast and the oven is still hot, the it\u2019s smart enough to adjust the cooking time if you want to make more, so your toast is always the same colour whether you start with a cold or hot oven.  A bagel took about 6 minutes with a cold oven, and when I wanted to toast another  it took just over 3 minutes.  This oven does take slightly longer to toast than the smart oven pro, but only about a minute longer. Some of the negative reviews for the Smart Oven Pro were regarding the control panel failing\u2026 so they\u2019ve added a cooling fan inside the Air\u2019s control panel to keep the sensitive electronics safe from overheating and prolonging the life of the oven, and they\u2019ve upped the warranty to two years instead of one.  Although the fan is annoying, if it helps keep the oven working longer, I can live with it. In our house, this oven gets used several times per day and it never let us down.  But I could go on forever about this oven, so I\u2019ll just list the things I liked and disliked the most. Things I liked most about this oven: -Light comes on when you open the door -Timer pauses when door is opened -Beeping sound level is adjustable and can be silenced completely -Seal on door wraps all around to keep more heat in, increasing efficiency -Oven Door stays open 1 to 4 inches without the need to prop it open -the thick, high-quality racks -Broiling feature works better than the Pro -Auto-eject for the toast and air fry levels -New magnetic rack-puller design -New fan design moves more air -Big, bright display is easy to read and interpret -2 racks instead of one -fits a 11lb roast turkey comfortably and gives amazing results -Bakes two pies at once or two sheets of cookies, and reminds you to rotate half way -Heats to within 10 degrees of set temperature -Proofing feature is a huge convenience -Phase Cook for combining two cooking cycles into one Dislikes -Convection Fan is incredibly loud especially in super mode -Front panel fan is loud and comes on any time the oven is activated, even in toast mode where the fan isn't really necessary. -I wish oven light would stay on until I turn it off -Takes longer to reach temperature, 20 minutes to reach 400F -No recipe book - I wish there was a book of recipes designed for this specific oven that take advantage of the Phase Cook feature , dehydration and other features -Rack edges rub on the glass in the 3rd or 4th rack position when opening and closing the door -Oven Size may be a bit large for smaller tasks Who\u2019s it for? I think this oven is for serious cooking, a bit overkill for a college student for example. It is really a real oven that can be used as a toaster oven.  If you think you will need a second oven at times, this is a great option.  Actually, this oven would make the ultimate wedding gift for newlyweds. Recommended? Yes!  Although slightly on the pricey side,  if you\u2019re looking for a countertop oven that can replace your range and can double as a toaster, the versatility, the convenience and features of this model will exceed your expectations as it did mine. With all the performance and capability of a large range oven, you\u2019ll absolutely love the top-of-the-line smart oven Air. Did you find this review helpful?  Vote yes down below!

First and foremost it is a top of the line toaster oven the size of a small oven.  You can fit a 1/2 pan, mid sized turkey is about its limit.  It has no hot spots because of its 6 computer controlled heating elements and a turbo fan to seal the deal.  It fits a standard frozen pizza or a Large Pap Murphy's Pizza.  Incredibly simple to use and accurate at low or high temperatures.  Yes you can dehydrate to make MSG free beef jerky, yes you can caramelize meats with precision with broiling, yes you can even proof bread!  The darn thing preheats in 2-4 mins! Not only does it do all this...  it is a top of the line air fryer!  It comes with 2 air fry pans, one for things that are low in fats and a second pan used for high in fat products like chicken wings.  My personal suggestion, spray a small amount of oil on low fat items to get an authentic fried food texture and flavor.  With out it things get hard... instead of deliciously crispy. In short I don't use my home oven unless its a bigger project. (family get together's)  Re-heating food from work has never been simpler!  I refuse to use microwaves!  Enjoy a high end product! The only warning I have is if you have kids or irresponsible roommates... (same thing haha!)  The oven gets hot.  Keep things off it and around it.

Flavor: somewhere between cardboard and a dish cloth. Yes, really--this was absolutely disgusting. There is no WAY those videos are real. Absolutely impossible. This product was revolting (a strong word, I know, but it is accurate). I ordered two bottles. The first bottle seemed to cook up properly with onions and herbs de Provence, but it was barely palatable--truly gross. It also produced mild nausea which lasted about two hours. I figured I should use it up, so against my better judgment, I opened the second bottle a few days later.  The second bottle was different - no matter how much I shook it, it seemed significantly thicker than the first, definitely not indicative of consistent product quality. This time, I added it to some cooked Soyrizo (soy-based chorizo; fantastic stuff which tastes just like chorizo), and the result was inedible (I have made Soyriozo and eggs countless times--one of my favorite breakfasts). I threw it away after eating about half of it. It tasted like wet cardboard with Soyrizo. Within 45 minutes, I was ill, throwing up. I think the JUST Egg had possibly spoiled, well before the best by date. Conclusion: this was a failed experiment, and ultimately, a gastric nightmare. And no, it has nothing to do with mung beans--I know I can eat them. As for the videos, this feels like false advertising. Anyone who claims this is indistinguishable from eggs is lying. I also have some of the frozen pre-made stuff I bought at the same time, which I have not used. I will likely toss it. This was both a waste of money and a terrible gastric experience.

(My doc teams with a naprapath and a nutritionist/herbalist to advise their Lyme patients). Califia makes my mornings a little easier with this blend.

It has just the right amount of vanilla and creamy texture without that weird taste. I didn\u2019t know they made a shelf stable option for this brand and was quite pleased to find it. I have only one store that\u2019s a 1 hour drive who carries this larger product in the refrigerated section. I think this smaller size is perfect since I\u2019m always worried about using the larger one before it starts to get a little whack... This one sold here is definitely not cost effective however the size and convenience of not taking up extra fridge space is worth the price. Also, I noticed a few reviews that said the taste was not the same as the larger refrigerated container.....well it tastes EXACTLY the same! I\u2019ve used two cartons so far and the both taste exactly the same. The only down side is that the shelf stable box expiration isn\u2019t that long (1.5 months) as compared to other brand shelf stable almond milks.  I was hoping that when I was in town I could buy the larger container and use this shelf stable container as a hold over until I made those trips but that won\u2019t be the case on this shipment.

The mouthfeel is key; it is more like cow's milk than anything out there. And, it has the same amount of protein and even more calcium.  It's great in cereal, coffee, tea, and dessert cocktails that usually call for cream.  I've even used it in pudding and mashed potatoes, as well as macaroni and cheese. The only time I find it gritty is when I haven't shaken it enough.  Although the Original - Unsweetened is my favorite, I stock up on these shelf-stable cartons for travel.  I do wish they would offer the unsweetened variety in these cartons, since we try to limit sugar.  But especially now, when we are trying to limit food shopping to once a month, these have been lifesavers.  As much as I appreciate these 8 ounce cartons when we travel, during this time of plague and pestilence, they're practically keeping us alive (please feel free to chuckle).  Thank you Ripple!
