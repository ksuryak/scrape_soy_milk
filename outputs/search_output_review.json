We tried them all - Califa Farms, Oatly, local store brands of oat and soy milks, Barista varieties and flax milk.  Didn't like how hemp milk because it changed the taste of the coffee. After working through all of them, the ONLY non-dairy milk to consistently turn out silky smooth thick foam as we would find with whole milk is Silk Soymilk.  We also discovered that the brand matters because the quality of the local private label brand of soy milk was inconsistent.  We have no idea what happens in their production process.  The store brand has the same amount of fat as Silk, so it should have worked just fine.  It didn't. Our morning latte's and cappuccinos consist of great espresso (our roast), hot flax milk for the base (shelf stable Good Karma brand is super creamy, the refrigerated version of Good Karma is a huge disappointment by comparison) and frothed Silk for the foamy finish.  We went old school with a Bialetti stovetop espresso maker and a Miroco milk frother, both available on Amazon.  One of our sister-in-laws wanted our big steamer/espresso machine and we were glad to see the back of it.  Geez, counter space once again and simple, yet fantastic, vegan coffee.

Costco's Kirkland Signature Brand Plain Soymilk, available by the 12-quart case at a very reasonable price, always gave  perfect results.  When Costco stopped carrying it, their \"vegan-friendly\" score dropped to zero in my book, and I dropped my longtime Costo membership. San Diego county markets carried other brands, unreliably stocked but reliably overpriced, and I got along fairly well for awhile, always hoping for another perfect balance of quality and price.  But after I discovered and began using a cheaper brand, the quality of my yogurt deteriorated, mostly the texture.  I searched again on Amazon, where I recently found the Silk Shelf-stable Original Soymilk that is my new go-to basic ingredient for great homemade  vegan yogurt!  (I use it for other things too...)

Though I do appreciate transparency by including exact gram measurements whenever possible. But there is a big difference between 1g of sugar and 3g of sugar (pay attention diabetics). There is a big difference between 4g of fiber and 1g of fiber (pay attention dieters counting net carbs). The taste is just so so. I already know the flavor of unsweetened soy is very bland, so I don't count this against the Westsoy brand. I used this as part of a tasty keto hot chocolate recipe which improves the flavor significantly. I wish I knew for certain which label was correct, but I know that had I first seen the label that I received in person, I would not have purchased it at all.

        "reviewdata": "This is by far my favorite non-dairy milk. It's just soy and water, with nothing else in it, which is awesome for baking purposes. It's done the trick in cakes, buttercreams, ganaches, and I also made a ricotta-like cheese with it! It's quite thick, too, and I really love its taste. As indicated, I mostly use it for baking as a milk replacement, but also it's great to drink by itself and doesn't coagulate in coffee (at least it hasn't in mine), which is nice. It will coagulate when you add vinegar, though, so it's great for a buttermilk replacement, too! Read more"

        "reviewdata": "Excellent soy milk. Tastes great in coffee and cereal. Its very close to the goodness of homemade soyamilk and definitely much more palatable and milk-like than that nasty tasting UHT boxed/shelf stable cow's milk. Even my milk and nut milk drinking friends are surprised by the great taste, which is also much better than store bought almond milk. It's a great improvement over the sickly sweet, vitamin and thickener added soymilk in the refrigerator section that almost made me give up on finding a great dairy alternative. More expensive too though. I wish it were available in 1/2 gallon or one gallon containers. Its on par with other brands whose only ingredients are whole soybeans and water, nothing else added. They're not easy to find so I buy and regularly use this one, organic unsweetened Edensoy, and organic undweetened Trader Joe's brands which all have the same ingredients. None have sweeteners, vitamins or thickeners and therefore no weird taste. Shelf stability (no preservatives!) means I can stock up when they're on sale. Add your own sweetener if needed. I make a great latte blending this with a few presoaked then drained cashews in my nutribullet blender. Foams up thick and beautifully plus it has fiber. Almost a breakfast in and of itself.

I ordered this product to use in cereal, thinking it was the UNSWEETENED version, and discovered by accident that it was pretty nice as a coffee creamer! It has only a very faint sweetness, a pretty pleasant taste, and a decent amount of creaminess for coffee. The amount of sugar is not too bad so I'm going to continue using this regular (not unsweetened) version as my go-to non-dairy creamer, even though I don't normally sweeten my coffee.

Sometimes I add a little chocolate syrup (Simply 5) or a  little (reduced calorie) slow churned ice cream.  They tend to sweeten it up a little. I dump a little of everthing in a bullet or blender, add some ice cubes and water and let 'er rip. Highly nutritional, high protein and tastes great while being low in fat.

As a rule, I still do not just drink a glass of alternative, becasue even though I use them for cereal and cooking, I do not find them to be very satisfying to drink straight up, not like a nice cup of real milk was to me! I ordered this carton of soy milk becasue they come in smaller packages, and sometimes I just want to use a little, and not risk letting the rest of a larger carton going bad if I don't finish it after opening. This just showed up on my doorstep today, right when I was making my morning coffee. I usually drink my coffee black, but since I knew I was going to do this review I figured I could also add it to my cup of joe and report back about that too. Well, I first opened it to deeply smell it, and it was quite pleasant, nothing offensive to it at all! So, I took a swig of it and wow, this milk tasted great!!! Almost better than any other soymilk I have ever tasted before! Really! So I then emptied out about 3/4 of this 6.42 oz package into my coffee and wow, It practically tasted like a regular creamer in my coffee... and it is sweet enough that I did not have to add any more sugar or sweetener. This drink was good enough like it is, but I can imagine adding other things like cinnamon, chocolate or vanilla, chai flavors, mint, and just about anything else to make it into a dessert type drink, using coffee or tea or nothing!!! I would give 5 stars just based on taste, but to me some of the ingredients take away from the nutritional goodness of what could be a totally healthy drink for those who can tolerate soy. The verdict might be out about HFCS, but I usually avoid anything with high fructose corn syrup in the added ingredients. (Sorry, but that is probably why this tastes so good and sweet, and I think a little bit of it now and then is not going to hurt me, much.) I really wished there was a different sweetener used in this, and no NOT stevia! It also has carrageenan in it, which doesn't agree with some person's systems. Normally when I a reading labels in the store I would walk right past this product, based on ingredients, but since it is in my possession (and the nonstrict side of me is happy that I have it) I am sure I will find many ways to enjoy these over time.

        "reviewdata": "Hanmi Calcium Sweetened Soymilk is a delicious sweetened soy milk that can be added to a lunch box or enjoyed as an anytime drink. There are sixteen 6.4 oz boxes with accompanying sealed plastic straws that can easily puncture the foil in its designated spot at the top of the TetraPak carton. The soy flavor is rich and bold while the drink finishes on a sweet note. It is silky smooth and has a creaminess to it that I really enjoyed. It didn't taste watered down like some other soy milks I have tried. I noticed my traditional milk drinking family really enjoyed this soymilk and drank it without any issues. It can be enjoyed either at room temperature or ice cold from the refrigerator. I found that I enjoyed it most when it was ice cold. There is a limited amount of information translated into English on the individual boxes. The nutritional information is posted on the product box that holds all sixteen boxes. In each single serving pack, there are 60 calories, 2g Total Fat, 7g Total Carbohydrate, and 4g Protein. There is 245.59mg Calcium in one box which is 24% of the Daily Value. The manufacturer did note that the product was manufactured in a facility that also processes milk, wheat, tree nuts (almond, brazil nut, cashew, pine nut, walnut), and peanut. If you have an allergy to any or all of these items, please be aware of this. The product is Made in South Korea. The product I received has a best by date of 7 months from the date I received it.  I really liked this soy milk and will definitely be buying it again. Read more"

        "reviewdata": "Does your soymilk need: corn syrup, corn oil, carageenan, sucralose, peanut flavor?  Well, this one apparently does. They took what could have been an outstanding, fully-ground soymilk, and turned it into a still very tasty, but overly processed drink. The taste itself is good, if a bit sweet. It's similar sweetness to those chocolate milk cartons, but didn't feel sugary at all and didn't spike my blood sugar (thanks to using mostly sucralose instead of corn syrup). It tastes like a rich, sweet soymilk with a slight hint of peanut flavor. The nutrition of these is good as well. With 60 calories, 4 grams fiber, 4 grams protein, 7g carbohydrates and only 4 grams added sugar - these are quite healthy. They also have 250mg calcium (added calcium) to make this kind of like a milk substitute. It gives a bit of a chalky taste - and personally I would seek out a variety without the added calcium, I'm not sure it's necessary to get 25% calcium in a tiny carton of soymilk. Overall - it tastes good and has good nutrition, but definitely has more ingredients than I would like. That being said - it is healthier than most soy milks out there, and I'm sure most kids would love the taste. Read more"

Flavor: The flavor is very complex and very nutty.  You can really taste the hints of roasted peanuts in it.  It is quite a bit more complex and flavorful then what I expected and delicious on its own with no need to add anything else. Shelf stable cartons: The small cartons are great for keeping on hand at work for an afternoon pickup and require no refrigeration required. Serving I am very content to have this served on ice or directly out of the box with a straw(included) at room temperature. Nutrition: At 6.4oz, 60 calories, with only 4g added sugar  and 4g protein , 4g fiber this is a healthy treat.  There is some sucralose for added sweetening but the flavor isn't compromised and it taste like a fully sugar sweetened drink.  There is 24% of the RDA of calcium also.

Most of the almond milks and coconut milks on the market tasted watery and bitter to me. This almondmilk was amazing in comparison, nice and thick and with a subtle oaty/rice undertone, almost like a hint of cereal taste--and I loved that it was unsweetened. Tastes great with cereal, oatmeal, coffee, and best of all, smoothies--and does not separate. It really helps to tone down the stevia aftertaste in most protein powders. Unfortunately, Orgain almondmilk is very hard to come by--It has been unavailable through subscribe and save for 3 months now and I can only find it at my local whole foods--and the price is now approaching $6 a carton. I was pretty bummed, however I recently discovered Silk protein nutmilk, almond & cashew (2g sugar variety) and it is a fantastic close second to this unsweetened Orgain. I still prefer orgain, but the Silk protein product is a super-close second and under four bucks for a half gallon, a much better value. Read more"

If you don't want a thick texture don't get this. I imagine it's from the added protein. Doesn't mix well with protein shakes or any weight loss shakes to be honest if you don't want them super thick. This adds additional thickness to the shake which could help many stay satiated in the long run. I approve. Just not for protein shakes lol....you have to eat them with a spoon. Read more"

It definitely has more almonds than other brands, since there's 3 grams of fat with almonds being the only ingredient that could provide it. The 7 grams of sugar goes a long way, it feels like there's more but that's just the pleasant vanilla flavoring. If you've ever had plain pea protein isolate, you probably thought of that idiom that you can't dress up a pig. Yet somehow the protein in here doesn't detract from the flavor at all. For my uses, mainly cereal, protein shakes and smoothies, I don't think I could find better. There is a slightly gritty aftertaste, but lets be honest. Where are you going to get your calcium if you're avoiding dairy? A whole bag of spinach? I doubt it. Read more"

It doesn't matter that much to my husband, because he only really uses it as an ingredient in things, since he has never been a big milk drinker.  I, on the other hand, used to drink milk as my primary beverage and loved it with pretty much every meal.  I really miss it.  So, I have tried pretty much every unsweetened milk alternative I could get my hands on -- you name it, I've almost certainly tried it (soy, almond, coconut, hemp, oat, hazelnut, blends thereof, etc. etc.).  I had never come across macadamia milk before, though.  So, when I saw it on sale for Prime Day, I jumped on it, even though it was a 6-pack.  It sounded pretty good, since I'm a fan of macadamias.  Plus, I figured it had good potential for milk, since they're such a creamy nut to begin with. And wow -- no regrets.  This milk is so rich and smooth, with none of that \"off\" aftertaste that most milk alternatives have.  It still isn't dairy -- so don't go in expecting that.  But that said, it is the closest I have ever come to finding a true milk replacement.  This is actually enjoyable to just drink by the glass or with a meal.  In particular, it's not too thin, and it doesn't have an overly distinctive, in-your-face kind of flavor.  It's neutral and goes well with almost anything, which is what I always loved about cow's milk.  If you've been searching like me and haven't been satisfied yet, I definitely recommend you try this stuff.  I was not disappointed, and I doubt you will be either. Read more"

Maybe three years ago, I gave up all dairy and eggs for a bit over a year because I'm not comfortable with how animals are treated in factory farms.  During that period, I used soy and almond milks, but I ended up going back to milk (trying to find the most humane brands offered in my area) because I just didn't feel good physically.  A couple of years later, I'm now suspecting that I've developed a lactose intolerance as I've gotten older, so I started looking for alternatives and found this. When I use this on cereal, I really don't notice a difference between it and milk.  I think it's great on cereal.  Yes, it definitely tastes different than milk, but the cereal masks that for me.  When drinking it straight, I think it's at least as good as soy or almond milk...which means that I don't think it's awesome, but it's not bad at all. The containers are very convenient.  You don't need to refrigerate this until you open one, although I do keep mine in the refrigerator so that they're already cold when I want to open a new one. No question, I wish that the price was lower.  At the moment, it's a bit more than twice as expensive as the milk that I was buying, which is already over twice as expensive as regular milk...so, this stuff isn't cheap.  But, I like the taste on cereal and I feel fine after having it. Read more"

Then one day a coworker suggested a local coffee shop that used this product. I loved it and quickly found it here on Amazon for my home use.  I have actually dropped any sweetening/flavoring and now just drink plain lattes.  It steams very well and even though I'm not a latte art expert, I can get a good foam if I try. This has the closest taste, texture and just plain mouth feel for me as the skim milk I was used to.

        "reviewdata": "This Hanmi soy milk has a nice toasty flavor, probably from the small amount of roasted brown rice powder in the ingredients.  It's unsweetened and has a tiny amount of salt, but doesn't taste salty. Among shelf-stable/tetrapak varieties (rather than fresh/refrigerated) soy milks, it's pretty good. It has a clean, unprocessed taste and a slightly powdery but still pleasantly smooth finish or mouthfeel.  I like that it's unsweetened, because most pre-sweetened soy milks are much too sweet.  It's made in South Korea. The full ingredients are: soymilk (water, soybean), refined salt, roasted brown rice powder, calcium carbonate, black soybean extract Though I like the flavor, one thing I don't like as much is that there's no indication that the soy is non-GMO, which means it's probably made with genetically modified soybeans.  All other things being equal, I prefer to avoid GMOs. It's important to note that this listing is for 24 cartons, but each carton is a single serving!  Each carton is small, only 6.4oz each (less than one cup).  The Tetrapaks come with attached little paper straws to puncture the foil circle.  The tetrapaks are convenient, especially for lunches on the go.  But while tetrapaks are theoretically recyclable, they are hard to recycle properly in most places. Read more"

I normally use soy milk only for baking, but the natural flavor of this plus the nice creamy texture makes it enjoyable for using it directly, such as in smoothies. It comes very nicely packaged. The 24 containers are in a sealed cardboard case with a handle. The case is then inside of a product box. While that's a lot of packaging, it kept everything in perfect shape for transit. Plus, the inner case is handy for storage (the individual packs are shelf stable until opened). The shelf life is somewhat short, which is the unavoidable trade-off for foods that don't have added preservatives or stabilizers. The pack I received in June 2022 has a best by date of October 2022. That's long enough to go through the pack of 24, but it's not long enough (at least for the amount of soy milk I normally go through) to stock up on a few cases. It is made in South Korea. This is one of the better soy milks that I've used in terms of flavor, composition and packaging convenience. Five stars. Read more"

The order includes twenty four 190ml boxes with accompanying sealed paper straws that can easily puncture the foil in its designated spot at the top of the TetraPak carton. I thought it was clever that the pure soybean milk used plain paper straws tying back to its \"pure\" concept. The soy flavor is present and yet it has a very savory taste with a slight gritty texture from the included roasted browned rice powder. It didn't taste watered down like some other soy milks I have tried. I did notice that my traditional milk drinking family enjoyed this soymilk and drank it without any issues but would note each time they drank it that it would have been nicer with a touch of sugar. It can be enjoyed either at room temperature or ice cold from the refrigerator. I found that I enjoyed it most when it was ice cold. There is a limited amount of information translated into English on the individual boxes. The nutritional information is posted on the product box that holds the cartons. In each single serving pack, there are 70 calories, 2.5g Total Fat, 5g Total Carbohydrate, and 5g Protein. The soymilk is made with soymilk, refined salt, roasted brown rice powder, calcium carbonate, and black soybean extract. The manufacturer did note that the product was manufactured in a facility that also processes milk, wheat, tree nuts (almond, brazil nut, cashew, pine nut, walnut), and peanut. If you have an allergy to any or all of these items, please be aware of this. The product is Made in South Korea. The product I received has a best by date of 5 months from the date I received it. I didn't mind the sugar free taste but I was not a fan of the semi-gritty texture thus I do not plan on purchasing this soymilk again. Read more"

        "reviewdata": "My husband typically uses alternative milk (soy, almond, etc) in his oatmeal every morning. He doesn't care for dairy milk and just likes adding some extra creaminess to his morning oats. You get 24 6.4 oz cartons of soy milk. They are all packaged in a sturdy box with carrying handle. These little soy milk single serve cartons are great for on the go. Each one comes with its own individually wrapped paper straw making it easy to drink anywhere! I love that they included paper straws as they are more environmentally friendly. Just be careful if you or your child finish these rather quickly as the straws will get soggy if you leave them in the little carton too long! The flavor was pretty good. It tasted like soy milk but did have a slight aftertaste. For this reason, we actually preferred using the milk in smoothies and oatmeal. It was PERFECT in both of those! The texture is smooth and creamy. My husband and I appreciate that these don't contain any added sugar. You would be surprised how many milk products have a TON of added sugar in them. The kids didn't like this milk because it isn't sweet at all. My youngest son kept saying that it tasted like earth. For the adults in the household, we enjoyed it! Read more"

        "reviewdata": "I absolutely love this! It is rich and indulgent like dairy whole milk, but since it has no lactose (milk sugar) it not only avoids the problems that lactose-intolerant people have, it has far fewer calories and natural sugars. Dairy whole milk contains 150 calories per 8 oz. serving (70 from fat), but this has 70 calories per serving with only 35 of those from fat. Dairy whole milk has 11 grams of sugars per 8 oz. serving, but this product has only 1 gram. For those of us trying to reduce our intake of foods that clog arteries, this is really nice because there is no cholesterol! Yay!  It is delicious to pour over cereal, include in recipes instead of dairy milk and you only have to refrigerate it after you open the carton. The first thing I prepared using this was mashed potatoes. They tasted as rich as when I have used cream rather than milk! I don't always use a lot of milk in a given week, so I would often throw out a large portion of a gallon or even half-gallon of refrigerated milk. Since this comes in 32 ounce (1 quart) cartons, I never waste any. It is very easy to store in a cupboard until I need it and a quart-size container takes up very little space in the refrigerator.The \"icing on the cake\" is that it is certified organic! Good for me, good for the planet!  I do, however, purchase it from Vitacost.com because the price is $2.89 per quart and shipping is free on orders over $49 and a flat-rate $4.99 for orders less than $49. Read more"

I've heard so many negative things about soy in general, I was very leary about using it, but after listening to a podcast by Chris Beats Cancer, and reading an article he wrote about the benefits of soy, then doing further research for myself, I started rethinking soy. When you do the research, you find that soy is not the enemy we've all been led to believe it is. Cows milk is a whole lot more dangerous for our bodies. Soy is very useful in a fight against cancer, or as a prevention. Don't believe me though, just do some research for yourself. Read more"

Apparently Silk Almond Milk has taken over although I can't figure out why since it doesn't compare in taste or texture to Vanilla Soy. We use it in coffee, smoothies and baked goods. This shelf-stable Silk is terrific especially during the pandemic. I just wish that it came in  1/2 gallon sizes. My only real criticism of the packaging is that like all boxed liquids packaged this way, it tends to spatter when poured. It isn't awful but a small annoyance.

The original soy milk (red box) is the best tasting soy milk for when I don't want the vanilla flavor. The prices for Silk are very reasonable on Amazon, they all are shelf stable with months to go and the six packs are super convenient. I buy 2-3  boxes of each type at a time to keep in my pantry.

These additives affect the flavor of the yogurt.  Soy yogurt made from Eden Soy Organic Unsweetened Soymilk (just soy beans and filtered water), has a clean fresh taste unlike anything I've experienced with commercial soy yogurt.  I also appreciate that this seller was able to get the soymilk to me undamaged.  It took two tries, but at least they reshipped rather than just issuing a refund.  Before ordering from them, I had purchased from three other sellers which, when the soymilk got damaged in shipment, just refunded my purchase price.

And they do it to become successful entrepreneurs and to provide good meat alternatives for us. I mean, why don't you do it yourself and see what happens? Very difficult. I appreciate the effort and care that goes into it. This is NOT a real egg and no one should be thinking it will taste exactly the same. It's a substitute.

Those videos are obviously works of fiction. This product is not even remotely close to eggs in anything but color. Texture: cardboard boxes pureed with canola oil, tapioca, and preservatives. Flavor: somewhere between cardboard and a dish cloth. Yes, really--this was absolutely disgusting. There is no WAY those videos are real. Absolutely impossible. This product was revolting (a strong word, I know, but it is accurate). I ordered two bottles. The first bottle seemed to cook up properly with onions and herbs de Provence, but it was barely palatable--truly gross. It also produced mild nausea which lasted about two hours. I figured I should use it up, so against my better judgment, I opened the second bottle a few days later.  The second bottle was different - no matter how much I shook it, it seemed significantly thicker than the first, definitely not indicative of consistent product quality. This time, I added it to some cooked Soyrizo (soy-based chorizo; fantastic stuff which tastes just like chorizo), and the result was inedible (I have made Soyriozo and eggs countless times--one of my favorite breakfasts). I threw it away after eating about half of it. It tasted like wet cardboard with Soyrizo. Within 45 minutes, I was ill, throwing up. I think the JUST Egg had possibly spoiled, well before the best by date. Conclusion: this was a failed experiment, and ultimately, a gastric nightmare. And no, it has nothing to do with mung beans--I know I can eat them. As for the videos, this feels like false advertising. Anyone who claims this is indistinguishable from eggs is lying. I also have some of the frozen pre-made stuff I bought at the same time, which I have not used. I will likely toss it. This was both a waste of money and a terrible gastric experience. I will never buy this again. Yuck. Caveat emptor. Read more"

My only complaint is that the pour spout is too small, so it is almost impossible to pour a new bottle without spilling: The air gets sucked into the container in spurts, causing small spills.  I work around this by punching holes in the top away from the spout to allow air to get in while pouring.  Pouring down the side of a glass works somewhat, but is slow, and requires both hands.

Honestly, the healthiest option out there. It makes my fruit smoothies taste so much better because of the vanilla taste. I usually blend it when I use it in my coffee. It makes my coffee taste better and I get all the benefits of chia and flax milk. Before Lechia, I had not found a chia and flax seed milk brand. I am going to keep buying this. It‚Äôs the best non dairy version of milk. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough on the nutritional benefits. Everyone needs to RUN to buy this. You‚Äôre missing out. Use a blender or frother when making hot coffee too. It makes it foamy. After using a blender, I just warm it up on the stove (I limit my use of microwave). Honestly, so good for it‚Äôs price.

All natural ingredients and the nutrition values fit what I look for perfectly. I took 1 star off however because the package had very strong scent of maybe air freshener clung to it. These packs or drinks were in a cardboard product box and then another thicker cardboard box inside a shipping box.

The little boxes are about the size of a Juicy Juice container and the soybean milk is thick and lightly sweet.  The flavor is most similar to Asian soybean drinks and unlike white soy milk, this milk has a very lightly gritty texture to it. It's not bad, but it is noticeable.  The color of this soybean drink is also not white - it has a color that reminds me of chocolate milk, which I guess makes sense since it does utilize the whole black soybean.  While these black soybean drinks are more expensive than purchasing in my local Asian supermarket, it is a nice option if you can't source it in your area, or simply want it delivered conveniently to your porch.  Overall, it's a tasty soymilk that helps stave away the munchies in the afternoon or to drink as a quick breakfast snack as I'm running out the door. Read more"

Such bull right?  ...pisses me off just thinking about it.  I honestly think that the packaging is too flimsy so sausages just fall right out in transport.

They specifically said something in their marketing that it isn't \"watery\"... not true! Even after thoroughly shaking it up, it is quite watery and I do not care for the flavor. I am fine paying more for the other brand... although it is more pricey, at least I am not paying for watered down coconut milk. I tried to return this stuff and was unable. So now I'm stuck with 6 boxes of this disappointing milk. I would say if you are adding it to a smoothie, it might be fine. But if you are looking for true, creamy milk with a good flavor, look elsewhere. I like to use mine as creamer... this stuff is way too watery to do the trick. I can't picture drinking this plain either. Update 2-21-19: I changed my review from 3 stars to 4 because I ended up being glad I ordered this coconut milk. It sat forever, initially, after I tried the first container. Recently I used some to make homemade hot chocolate and it's perfect for that! I will be repurchasing after all. For cereals or drinking plain, it's still a definite no. But for smoothies and hot chocolate, I'm really happy to have this as a Vitamin D2-free option. Read more"

Being on an anti-inflammatory diet--no sugar, dairy, grains--it has been a challenge to find a suitable creamer for my coffee, other than coconut cream.  This product is a game changer!  I've tried many other brands, but the taste and consistency were always off.  Sorry Nut Pods fans--that product has a wanky aftertaste that I just can't tolerate, even in the flavored varieties.  It also doesn't seem to stay fresh as long as the Califia, out of or in the refrigerator. The Califia Farms Shelf Stable Almond Milk, Unsweetened Vanilla, is perfection as far as I'm concerned.  I order in bulk, and each container is always as fresh as can be.  Personally, I think the vanilla improves the flavor and tastes more like real \"milk\" to me, but it does not have an overpowering \"vanilla\" flavor.  I use this in sauces, mashed potatoes, and other things for my guys, and they have no idea they aren't getting cow's milk--and they are picky! I would love to try the Califia Keto Creamer, but it's not available in a single package for a reasonable price on Amazon, so I'm sticking to what I know is great.

This one sold here is definitely not cost effective however the size and convenience of not taking up extra fridge space is worth the price. Also, I noticed a few reviews that said the taste was not the same as the larger refrigerated container.....well it tastes EXACTLY the same! I‚Äôve used two cartons so far and the both taste exactly the same. The only down side is that the shelf stable box expiration isn‚Äôt that long (1.5 months) as compared to other brand shelf stable almond milks.

It's perfect for school lunches and the straw is long enough to get every last drop out of the carton.

This is the magic ingredient for your lattes.  This soy, along with Heart Coffee Roasters Stereo Blend beans, and the Breville BMF600XL Milk Cafe Milk Frother make PERFECT lattes. My wife and I enjoy 2 lattes apiece a day. We prefer these to any coffee shop version, except maybe that one little cafe in Florence, Italy... but there were other factors in play. Our soy lattes feel extravagant, and we wondered what each cup costs, given the $85 bag of coffee beans and the $50 box of soy. We went looked through 8 months of receipts, and, averaging the costs of beans and soy over six months, each latte costs... wait for it... 68 cents. Also, I will put in a good word for the distributor. One case had been accidentally cut with a box cutter, and one carton of soy leaked. I emailed the company, and they refunded the cost of the lost soy carton. Read more"

This soy milk is thicker, richer, and creamier than any other soy milk I have tried in the past, and this beverage tastes as if I am drinking 100% real soy milk, not any watered down version. I do think $1.81 for a small carton of soy milk is pricey, but what makes this one different from others is the nutrition facts. This milk has a lot of postbiotics along with a good amount of iron and calcium. There are only four grams of protein, but we all intake almost too much protein from daily food consuming anyways, so it is not an issue for me. I also like the small packaging size that is convenient for pack and carry. I packed one in my son‚Äôs lunch bag‚Äîhe did not like the flavor. Overall, this is real soy milk that has better nutrition and creamier consistency. This milk is a bit pricey, but the quality and the environment conscious product packaging (paper cartoon+paper straw) are worth the price, in my opinion. Read more"

Almond milk tends to be a weak substitute as a creamer as it's more watery. One carton of this soy milk is just right for my hot cereal and coffee.

Especially when it's primary use is for constipation? Bc it's a non digestible sweetener. If you watch sugar, doesn't raise blood sugar. 2nd fun fact? Contains Carrageenan. A thickening agent linked to colon cancer & IBS. It's like 'Hanmi' made this to stress out a stomach. None of this info was avail when I gave this a shot or it would've been a pass. Just wanted small shelf stable milk for when I wanted cereal.. If you want juice box size milk to keep the kids \"regular\", maybe a win for you. Some other info~ *The milk is brown. Maybe the rice? Black bean extract? * The only English is on the outside of the case with complete Nutritional Info. * Every individual box is all Asian writing. * Weird texture/thickness..? Can't really describe. Not gritty.. maybe powdery? * Not Nut Friendly. Made in a facility with, well.. every nut on the planet. At a 1.50@ box, lack of quality ingredients isn't justified.

If you drink sweetened soy milk it does taste quite different.  My kids love this soy milk and want it for lunch every day.  Even my \"picky-eater\" took to it right away.  The nutrition profile is significantly better than most sweetened soy milk. If you are looking mainly for the health benefits of soy milk I think this is a very good choice.

        "reviewdata": "I haven't had soy milk in several years, since almond milk and oat milk because readily available. But I used to drink it when I was mostly vegan, and I've had my share of soy yogurt and other products. I used to keep little boxes of soy milk on hand, especially in my car, for when I got hungry and wanted something quick to take the edge off. So I thought that perhaps this soy milk might fill a similar gap for me--a quick snack now than then. Unfortunately, from the first swig of the first box I tried, I could barely choke it down. There's a kind of grassy undertaste that really doesn't sit right with me and that the soy milk I used to drink never had. I don't know if it's the result of adding the probiotics or the \"grinding\" that's touted on the listing page, or something else about how the soy beans were grown or processed. Rather than finishing the box, I poured the rest down the drain. And BTW, everything on the box is in Korean, so it's impossible to know more about it--you need to rely on the Amazon page. Tastes are individual, so others may like it just fine, but this is definitely not going to work for me. Read more"

The milk is smooth, creamy and has a mild almond flavor.  The vanilla flavor is also quite mild, but both can be detected if used in savory dishes.  The kid used the almond milk in macaroni and cheese, and it ended up giving the dish a sweet, nutty flavor to the dish.  With that in mind, almond milk is good if you like the taste of almonds and don‚Äôt mind imparting a slightly nutty flavor when used in baked goods and entrees.  If you want a substitute for milk that tastes most like milk, Oat is the closest I‚Äôve tried so far.  Overall, this is a good milk alternative that everyone in our house enjoyed. Read more"

        "reviewdata": "I love almond milk, as it has more protein than skim milk, and I have to find a variety of ways to get protein because I don't really like the taste of most meats, and I cringe when I think about slaughtering. (I especially hate the killing of baby calves for veal! I've never tasted it and never will! It's just cruel!) Anyway, I buy several half-gallons of this when I grocery shop to use in my protein drinks and for cold cereal, but I had to order some when I couldn't get out for a while. I seriously DO NOT recommend that you buy this from Amazon. All six cartons already had the aluminum seals completely punctured (just as all five cartons of caffeine-free chai tea I ordered did), so I believe that Amazon is buying these products heavily discounted from the manufacturers because Blue Diamond knows these are cartons it cannot put on shelves in grocery stores for sale. There was no way that it was from a damaged shipment, as Amazon claimed when I contacted them about the seals on the tea. There was no indication of physical damage on even one of the cartons, and the seals are completely and perfectly punctured through around the entire circumference of the spout. That tells me that they were knowingly purchased by Amazon in that condition. I mean, what is the likelihood of two different companies' cartons for two entirely different products being in that condition, and with every single carton you receive? That likelihood is slim to none -- at least in a grocery store. All I have to say is do not buy these or any other liquids in cartons from Amazon. You never know what someone might have put inside those opened cartons, and you should never try drinking any to find out. We've been taught that ever since sickos began putting razor blades, needles and drugs in Halloween treats and OTC medications have been tampered with. Don't take the chance! Read more"

I'm not a vegan or anything like that. I have just never liked the idea of cow milk, especially after spending a lot of time on dairy farms. For some reason, the slight smell of milk always makes me genuinely sick to my stomach which is strange because I am no picky eater. Anyhow, I use this in place of milk everywhere and have never had to change a recipe because of it. Actually, the most I use this for is to make what tastes almost identical to Yohoo drinks. I just use some chocolate Ovaltine dissolved in this milk with some honey and man... good stuff. Makes amazing smoothies, makes the absolute best cheese sauces (no Velveeta in this house), and everything in between. However, not the best creamer for coffee, but I don't drink a lot of coffee, so meh. I use the canned coconut cream for that. To thicken the coconut cream, I just put it in an open container in the fridge for a day or two. That turns it into a perfect cream, but enough about that... Great product, always fast shipping, and it's perfect since I can store unopened containers outside of my fridge. Read more"

It has a very neutral flavor (does not taste like almonds), and this one especially (original, not vanilla) can be used in all kinds of stuff from mac n cheese to smoothies.  It tends to be a little cheaper in physical supermarkets than online, but I bet that'll change soon with Amazon's recent purchase of Whole Foods. No sugar is the way to go with these non-dairy milks -- regular milk doesn't have cane sugar added to it, and there's really no need to use it as it's just providing empty calories. Here are a few of the things I use it for: - in smoothies -- good base for protein shakes and/or blended frozen fruit smoothies - in coffee or tea -- doesn't feather or curdle, cold or hot - in sauces -- good sub for milk or cream if you're veganizing a recipe - in mac n cheese -- stays thick - in oatmeal -- a good base or addition to oatmeal to make it creamier than making it with water - in baking -- 1:1 sub for regular milk - by itself -- doesn't taste watery, nice if you can't have dairy but occasionally miss a cold glass of cow milk. Thickness-wise, it's probably comparable to 2% milk.  Definitely recommend if you're trying to cut back on your dairy. Read more"

The non-protein version is much different than regular original, which I once ordered by mistake.  I use less of this versus almond or coconut milk (bc they are mostly water) to get a nice Carmel color in my coffee.

That being said I LOVED MILK I couldn‚Äôt imagine having to give it up... but this soy milk is so good I don‚Äôt care for the plain soy milk and the regular vanilla is ok but this is amazing. The only thing is it‚Äôs pretty sweet so putting it on cereal is tricky I personally only buy a cereal that is NOT sweet so I get the sweetness from the very vanilla soy milk; plain Cheerios or life are my favs. It‚Äôs not good for cooking or adding to recipes so if you have to use this for dietary restriction reasons then I personally buy a small carton of Lactaid when needed. If using as a healthy alternative to milk then ENJOY, it only has 150 Calories per single serve carton and 8g of protein. I believe it also has more calcium then milk. üëçüèºüëçüèº Read more"

And....only humans actually consume milk after they are weaned. I love almonds, so I thought it was only natural to try Almond \"Milk\" . I do like the occasional bowl of cereal and the rich cup of hot  chocolate. Keep it cold, shake it good and pour. It work well in just about every instance where milk is used. Silk comes in so many different varieties of Almond Milk that I am sure just about everyone will find what they are looking for. I use the Vanilla sweetened variety. I also use it because I suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease and regular animal milk actually makes my condition worse. This product is actually pretty shelf-stable...you can buy in bulk and store on the shelf. Bottom line: Silk Almond milk comes in a bunch of varieties, is very shelf stable (order in bulk), comes in smaller sized cartons so it wont take up much room in the Fridge, the flavor is delicious  (you wont miss milk) It actually tastes yummy on cereal and hot cocoa....and I am sure a million other different recipes. It's really affordable. Read more"

It is good for using on cereal or drinking straight from a glass.  It has less calories, more protein being a nut.  It is wonderful to think there is no shelf life on it.  Makes it great for emergencies or when you don't have electricity.  The size is smaller, so you can plan on using better and not get more than you need and having it spoil on you.  The cost is much cheaper.  It also is less risky for Disease and things possibly used in it like antibiotics or hormones.  Silk just totally makes sense. Read more"

The inner carton was secure and unsealed. When I got to the actual almond milk, the cartons had new packaging and were in perfect shape. The expiration date is over seven months away but I tend to borrow from my stash once in a while between shopping trips so that is great for me.

Their chocolate milk is great and indistinguishable from a cow's milk version. Also Barista almond milk which I prefer to plain Barista. It lacks the aftertaste of other nut milks--no comparison. I cannot say enough about Ripple products--all are great and I have made a permanent change to them.

I put it on my husband‚Äôs oatmeal (sweetened with raisins and bananas) this morning and he didn‚Äôt notice the difference. I normally use unsweetened organic soy milk but given the soy bean shortage, that can be hard to come by these days so I was looking for an alternative. I knew this was not organic and that they add cane sugar but decided to give it a try.  I‚Äôm a bit offended that they advertise half the sugar of milk‚Äù as if the added cane sugar is somehow the same as the naturally occurring sugar in milk (lactose).  If you are concerned about sugar in your diet, take a look at the glycemic index and glycemic load of these various sugars and decide for yourself what is right for you. I understand that taste is very subjective and that nutritional preferences and requirements  are also not the same for everyone.  I included a picture of nutritional values of this product and an organic soy milk with no added sugar so that people can look and compare the components most important to their own decisions. I don‚Äôt have dairy milk in the house so couldn‚Äôt include that. Bottom line, this isn‚Äôt the right product for me but people who enjoy sweets may like it. Read more"

I take soy to help with menopause symptoms and it really helps. This is a great product to keep around if you can't get to the grocery store or camping, to keep some at work to use as coffee creamer, etc.  If you are going to mix this, you can use slightly warm water to make a container to put in  your fridge. Shake/mix well and then put in the fridge to slowly cool. It should mix better and stay better. I add a tinge of maple syrup and it's very good as a straight glass of soy milk! Read more"

Avoiding foods with dairy, added sugars, or sugar alcohols isn't always easy for me. This product really helps! I find the consistency of this to be comparable to other nut milks without a lot of thickener in them. I never liked the consistency of milk with fat in it. I liked skim milk only.

Most of the almond milks and coconut milks on the market tasted watery and bitter to me. This almondmilk was amazing in comparison, nice and thick and with a subtle oaty/rice undertone, almost like a hint of cereal taste--and I loved that it was unsweetened. Tastes great with cereal, oatmeal, coffee, and best of all, smoothies--and does not separate. It really helps to tone down the stevia aftertaste in most protein powders. Unfortunately, Orgain almondmilk is very hard to come by--It has been unavailable through subscribe and save for 3 months now and I can only find it at my local whole foods--and the price is now approaching $6 a carton. I was pretty bummed, however I recently discovered Silk protein nutmilk, almond & cashew (2g sugar variety) and it is a fantastic close second to this unsweetened Orgain. I still prefer orgain, but the Silk protein product is a super-close second and under four bucks for a half gallon, a much better value. Read more"

If you don't want a thick texture don't get this. I imagine it's from the added protein. Doesn't mix well with protein shakes or any weight loss shakes to be honest if you don't want them super thick. This adds additional thickness to the shake which could help many stay satiated in the long run. I approve. Just not for protein shakes lol....you have to eat them with a spoon. Read more"

It definitely has more almonds than other brands, since there's 3 grams of fat with almonds being the only ingredient that could provide it. The 7 grams of sugar goes a long way, it feels like there's more but that's just the pleasant vanilla flavoring. If you've ever had plain pea protein isolate, you probably thought of that idiom that you can't dress up a pig. Yet somehow the protein in here doesn't detract from the flavor at all. For my uses, mainly cereal, protein shakes and smoothies, I don't think I could find better. There is a slightly gritty aftertaste, but lets be honest. Where are you going to get your calcium if you're avoiding dairy? A whole bag of spinach? I doubt it. Read more"

Read your label on store bought soy milk; I think you'll find lots of \"other\" things added.

Sometimes I add a little chocolate syrup (Simply 5) or a  little (reduced calorie) slow churned ice cream.  They tend to sweeten it up a little. I dump a little of everthing in a bullet or blender, add some ice cubes and water and let 'er rip. Highly nutritional, high protein and tastes great while being low in fat.

One problem I did have: The package is supposed to be able to be re-sealed, but I struggled and eventually gave up trying to zip it closed.

I calculated this by grams of protein instead of recommended mix volume,  as the protein and fat are a little different in proportion than Silk. That makes this product $2/half gallon, significantly cheaper than premixed Silk. The taste and aroma are beanier, but not unpleasantly so. It mixed easily with a fork in the cup, with some foam rising after it sat. The zipper closure on the bag isn‚Äôt very good. I will buy more to stock up my pantry. Read more"

And, it has the same amount of protein and even more calcium.  It's great in cereal, coffee, tea, and dessert cocktails that usually call for cream.  I've even used it in pudding and mashed potatoes, as well as macaroni and cheese. The only time I find it gritty is when I haven't shaken it enough.  Although the Original - Unsweetened is my favorite, I stock up on these shelf-stable cartons for travel.  I do wish they would offer the unsweetened variety in these cartons, since we try to limit sugar.  But especially now, when we are trying to limit food shopping to once a month, these have been lifesavers.  As much as I appreciate these 8 ounce cartons when we travel, during this time of plague and pestilence, they're practically keeping us alive (please feel free to chuckle).  Thank you Ripple!

It is rich and indulgent like dairy whole milk, but since it has no lactose (milk sugar) it not only avoids the problems that lactose-intolerant people have, it has far fewer calories and natural sugars. Dairy whole milk contains 150 calories per 8 oz. serving (70 from fat), but this has 70 calories per serving with only 35 of those from fat. Dairy whole milk has 11 grams of sugars per 8 oz. serving, but this product has only 1 gram. For those of us trying to reduce our intake of foods that clog arteries, this is really nice because there is no cholesterol! Yay!  It is delicious to pour over cereal, include in recipes instead of dairy milk and you only have to refrigerate it after you open the carton. The first thing I prepared using this was mashed potatoes. They tasted as rich as when I have used cream rather than milk! I don't always use a lot of milk in a given week, so I would often throw out a large portion of a gallon or even half-gallon of refrigerated milk. Since this comes in 32 ounce (1 quart) cartons, I never waste any. It is very easy to store in a cupboard until I need it and a quart-size container takes up very little space in the refrigerator.The \"icing on the cake\" is that it is certified organic! Good for me, good for the planet!  I do, however, purchase it from Vitacost.com because the price is $2.89 per quart and shipping is free on orders over $49 and a flat-rate $4.99 for orders less than $49. Read more"

As a rule, I still do not just drink a glass of alternative, becasue even though I use them for cereal and cooking, I do not find them to be very satisfying to drink straight up, not like a nice cup of real milk was to me! I ordered this carton of soy milk becasue they come in smaller packages, and sometimes I just want to use a little, and not risk letting the rest of a larger carton going bad if I don't finish it after opening. This just showed up on my doorstep today, right when I was making my morning coffee. I usually drink my coffee black, but since I knew I was going to do this review I figured I could also add it to my cup of joe and report back about that too. Well, I first opened it to deeply smell it, and it was quite pleasant, nothing offensive to it at all! So, I took a swig of it and wow, this milk tasted great!!! Almost better than any other soymilk I have ever tasted before! Really! So I then emptied out about 3/4 of this 6.42 oz package into my coffee and wow, It practically tasted like a regular creamer in my coffee... and it is sweet enough that I did not have to add any more sugar or sweetener. This drink was good enough like it is, but I can imagine adding other things like cinnamon, chocolate or vanilla, chai flavors, mint, and just about anything else to make it into a dessert type drink, using coffee or tea or nothing!!! I would give 5 stars just based on taste, but to me some of the ingredients take away from the nutritional goodness of what could be a totally healthy drink for those who can tolerate soy. The verdict might be out about HFCS, but I usually avoid anything with high fructose corn syrup in the added ingredients. (Sorry, but that is probably why this tastes so good and sweet, and I think a little bit of it now and then is not going to hurt me, much.) I really wished there was a different sweetener used in this, and no NOT stevia! It also has carrageenan in it, which doesn't agree with some person's systems. Normally when I a reading labels in the store I would walk right past this product, based on ingredients, but since it is in my possession (and the nonstrict side of me is happy that I have it) I am sure I will find many ways to enjoy these over time.

There are sixteen 6.4 oz boxes with accompanying sealed plastic straws that can easily puncture the foil in its designated spot at the top of the TetraPak carton. The soy flavor is rich and bold while the drink finishes on a sweet note. It is silky smooth and has a creaminess to it that I really enjoyed. It didn't taste watered down like some other soy milks I have tried. I noticed my traditional milk drinking family really enjoyed this soymilk and drank it without any issues. It can be enjoyed either at room temperature or ice cold from the refrigerator. I found that I enjoyed it most when it was ice cold. There is a limited amount of information translated into English on the individual boxes. The nutritional information is posted on the product box that holds all sixteen boxes. In each single serving pack, there are 60 calories, 2g Total Fat, 7g Total Carbohydrate, and 4g Protein. There is 245.59mg Calcium in one box which is 24% of the Daily Value. The manufacturer did note that the product was manufactured in a facility that also processes milk, wheat, tree nuts (almond, brazil nut, cashew, pine nut, walnut), and peanut. If you have an allergy to any or all of these items, please be aware of this. The product is Made in South Korea. The product I received has a best by date of 7 months from the date I received it.  I really liked this soy milk and will definitely be buying it again. Read more"

They took what could have been an outstanding, fully-ground soymilk, and turned it into a still very tasty, but overly processed drink. The taste itself is good, if a bit sweet. It's similar sweetness to those chocolate milk cartons, but didn't feel sugary at all and didn't spike my blood sugar (thanks to using mostly sucralose instead of corn syrup). It tastes like a rich, sweet soymilk with a slight hint of peanut flavor. The nutrition of these is good as well. With 60 calories, 4 grams fiber, 4 grams protein, 7g carbohydrates and only 4 grams added sugar - these are quite healthy. They also have 250mg calcium (added calcium) to make this kind of like a milk substitute. It gives a bit of a chalky taste - and personally I would seek out a variety without the added calcium, I'm not sure it's necessary to get 25% calcium in a tiny carton of soymilk. Overall - it tastes good and has good nutrition, but definitely has more ingredients than I would like. That being said - it is healthier than most soy milks out there, and I'm sure most kids would love the taste. Read more"

What about that screams creamer, I have no idea. But needless to say, this is NOT coffee creamer, it is plain almondmilk, which just happens to have a creamy consistency. Califia Farms has other products that are in fact advertised as creamers, please buy that. On to the actual product, it's wonderful. The taste is where it's at. It is smooth, and not grainy like many almondmilk's can be. However, I will say that the foaming capacity of the milk is not really there. I use a Nespresso foamer and it makes the tiniest amount of foam. So, this is great for just plain lattes or milk for cereal/oatmeal/whatever. Best part about this is the taste and the ingredients. They're as minimal as can be for typical almondmilk's. Read more"

I love Almond Breeze and I will continue to drink Almond milk which is far better than cow's milk for the body.

As another review mentioned, the insert for the tray in the center console is the wrong size, it is too big.  This may be due to the wireless charger taking up space.  I knew this going in, so that's perfectly fine for me. The 2nd one is the center cupholder if you have captains chairs in the 2nd row.  It looks like it only has the insert for a bench seat with the fold down divider, not captains chairs.  This is piece #12 in the picture in the item description.

When all of my local groceries ran out of Oatly, I decided to purchase this shelf-stable version from Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes almost EXACTLY like Oatly, with the added bonus that I can store unopened ones in my pantry and not worry about my precious fridge space during this pandemic. The only downside to this brand is the cost. This is approx. $5 for each 1 liter (34 oz) container, while Oatly is $5 for each half gallon (64 oz) container. Read more"

        "reviewdata": "We've been drinking Califia Barista Oat Milk and much enjoying it, but worried about Glyphosate content since Califia is not organic.  Delighted when I found this Organic one, tried a case to see if it was comparable, and it's every bit as tasty, and no Glyphosate since it's Organic.  I drink it by the glass, like I did Cow's Milk as a kid.  Yum.  Goes great with Rebbl, for example Hazelnut Protein or Cold Brew Coffee Protein. Califia Barista says 3g sugar per 8oz, while this one says 13g sugar per 8 oz.  However, there's very little if any difference in taste or sweetness, so I'm assuming that since this is imported from Italy it's using a European method for calculating, while Califia uses a California method. As of April 2022 they seem to have fixed the \"under-lid seal\" problem, where the plastic tab ring used to pull out of the foil seal before the foil seal pulled out of the carton.  Either that, or I've finally mastered the right technique for pulling the tab, because the tab now pulls the foil seal out perfectly every time when I PULL STRAIGHT UP on the tab. Read more"

We have tried a few oats milk but most of them have very little carbs and/or fats - something growing babies really need. This particular brand has the most carbs and a good amount of fat of all the brands we have tried (which is about 5) Sometimes, to add more calories I'll add 1 teaspoon of coconut oil and 1 teaspoon of collagen powder. We also give him liquid infant vitamins to make sure he is getting his RDA of micro-nutrients. He seems to be thriving on it, no longer has gas issues and actually enjoys drinking his milk.

I've heard so many negative things about soy in general, I was very leary about using it, but after listening to a podcast by Chris Beats Cancer, and reading an article he wrote about the benefits of soy, then doing further research for myself, I started rethinking soy. When you do the research, you find that soy is not the enemy we've all been led to believe it is. Cows milk is a whole lot more dangerous for our bodies. Soy is very useful in a fight against cancer, or as a prevention. Don't believe me though, just do some research for yourself. Read more"

They specifically said something in their marketing that it isn't \"watery\"... not true! Even after thoroughly shaking it up, it is quite watery and I do not care for the flavor. I am fine paying more for the other brand... although it is more pricey, at least I am not paying for watered down coconut milk. I tried to return this stuff and was unable. So now I'm stuck with 6 boxes of this disappointing milk. I would say if you are adding it to a smoothie, it might be fine. But if you are looking for true, creamy milk with a good flavor, look elsewhere. I like to use mine as creamer... this stuff is way too watery to do the trick. I can't picture drinking this plain either. Update 2-21-19: I changed my review from 3 stars to 4 because I ended up being glad I ordered this coconut milk. It sat forever, initially, after I tried the first container. Recently I used some to make homemade hot chocolate and it's perfect for that! I will be repurchasing after all. For cereals or drinking plain, it's still a definite no. But for smoothies and hot chocolate, I'm really happy to have this as a Vitamin D2-free option. Read more"

I‚Äôm lactose intolerant, but haven‚Äôt always been, so I‚Äôm constantly on the hunt for a milk alternative that mimics the neutral flavor and consistency of cow‚Äôs milk. I think I finally found the winner. I‚Äôve tried almond, oat, cashew, flax, soy ‚Äî you name it ‚Äî this brand of macadamia is the best that I have tried. It‚Äôs low-carb and low-cal but not watery at all. The mac nut gives it good body without significant fat content. I eat low-fat and low-carb foods so this fits for my nutrition needs. Seems like lots of good stuff in this milk as far as healthiness goes. Oh, and my 5-year-old likes it too!

        "reviewdata": "This Hanmi soy milk has a nice toasty flavor, probably from the small amount of roasted brown rice powder in the ingredients.  It's unsweetened and has a tiny amount of salt, but doesn't taste salty. Among shelf-stable/tetrapak varieties (rather than fresh/refrigerated) soy milks, it's pretty good. It has a clean, unprocessed taste and a slightly powdery but still pleasantly smooth finish or mouthfeel.  I like that it's unsweetened, because most pre-sweetened soy milks are much too sweet.  It's made in South Korea. The full ingredients are: soymilk (water, soybean), refined salt, roasted brown rice powder, calcium carbonate, black soybean extract Though I like the flavor, one thing I don't like as much is that there's no indication that the soy is non-GMO, which means it's probably made with genetically modified soybeans.  All other things being equal, I prefer to avoid GMOs. It's important to note that this listing is for 24 cartons, but each carton is a single serving!  Each carton is small, only 6.4oz each (less than one cup).  The Tetrapaks come with attached little paper straws to puncture the foil circle.  The tetrapaks are convenient, especially for lunches on the go.  But while tetrapaks are theoretically recyclable, they are hard to recycle properly in most places. Read more"

The 24 containers are in a sealed cardboard case with a handle. The case is then inside of a product box. While that's a lot of packaging, it kept everything in perfect shape for transit. Plus, the inner case is handy for storage (the individual packs are shelf stable until opened). The shelf life is somewhat short, which is the unavoidable trade-off for foods that don't have added preservatives or stabilizers. The pack I received in June 2022 has a best by date of October 2022. That's long enough to go through the pack of 24, but it's not long enough (at least for the amount of soy milk I normally go through) to stock up on a few cases. It is made in South Korea. This is one of the better soy milks that I've used in terms of flavor, composition and packaging convenience. Five stars. Read more"

        "reviewdata": "Hanmi Pure Soy Milk is a sugar-free soybean milk that you can enjoy anytime and anywhere. The order includes twenty four 190ml boxes with accompanying sealed paper straws that can easily puncture the foil in its designated spot at the top of the TetraPak carton. I thought it was clever that the pure soybean milk used plain paper straws tying back to its \"pure\" concept. The soy flavor is present and yet it has a very savory taste with a slight gritty texture from the included roasted browned rice powder. It didn't taste watered down like some other soy milks I have tried. I did notice that my traditional milk drinking family enjoyed this soymilk and drank it without any issues but would note each time they drank it that it would have been nicer with a touch of sugar. It can be enjoyed either at room temperature or ice cold from the refrigerator. I found that I enjoyed it most when it was ice cold. There is a limited amount of information translated into English on the individual boxes. The nutritional information is posted on the product box that holds the cartons. In each single serving pack, there are 70 calories, 2.5g Total Fat, 5g Total Carbohydrate, and 5g Protein. The soymilk is made with soymilk, refined salt, roasted brown rice powder, calcium carbonate, and black soybean extract. The manufacturer did note that the product was manufactured in a facility that also processes milk, wheat, tree nuts (almond, brazil nut, cashew, pine nut, walnut), and peanut. If you have an allergy to any or all of these items, please be aware of this. The product is Made in South Korea. The product I received has a best by date of 5 months from the date I received it. I didn't mind the sugar free taste but I was not a fan of the semi-gritty texture thus I do not plan on purchasing this soymilk again. Read more"

        "reviewdata": "My husband typically uses alternative milk (soy, almond, etc) in his oatmeal every morning. He doesn't care for dairy milk and just likes adding some extra creaminess to his morning oats. You get 24 6.4 oz cartons of soy milk. They are all packaged in a sturdy box with carrying handle. These little soy milk single serve cartons are great for on the go. Each one comes with its own individually wrapped paper straw making it easy to drink anywhere! I love that they included paper straws as they are more environmentally friendly. Just be careful if you or your child finish these rather quickly as the straws will get soggy if you leave them in the little carton too long! The flavor was pretty good. It tasted like soy milk but did have a slight aftertaste. For this reason, we actually preferred using the milk in smoothies and oatmeal. It was PERFECT in both of those! The texture is smooth and creamy. My husband and I appreciate that these don't contain any added sugar. You would be surprised how many milk products have a TON of added sugar in them. The kids didn't like this milk because it isn't sweet at all. My youngest son kept saying that it tasted like earth. For the adults in the household, we enjoyed it! Read more"

The original soy milk (red box) is the best tasting soy milk for when I don't want the vanilla flavor. The prices for Silk are very reasonable on Amazon, they all are shelf stable with months to go and the six packs are super convenient. I buy 2-3  boxes of each type at a time to keep in my pantry.

These additives affect the flavor of the yogurt.  Soy yogurt made from Eden Soy Organic Unsweetened Soymilk (just soy beans and filtered water), has a clean fresh taste unlike anything I've experienced with commercial soy yogurt.  I also appreciate that this seller was able to get the soymilk to me undamaged.  It took two tries, but at least they reshipped rather than just issuing a refund.  Before ordering from them, I had purchased from three other sellers which, when the soymilk got damaged in shipment, just refunded my purchase price.  I'm glad they did, but I really needed the soymilk for my new soy yogurt addiction. Read more"

It is NOT the full-fat version. It has, as another reviewer pointed out, water, locust gum, and vitamins added (compared to the canned version having two ingredients). It has only 5 grams of fat for 1 cup vs. 12 grams of fat for 1/4 cup of the canned version. Of course, after I ordered this the canned version came back in stock. But this is not usable for sauces, curry, or even my preferred smoothie consistency. It will be fine on cereal and in coffee.

I got this as part of my first whole foods market order and thought it would be similar to SO Delicious boxed coconut milk or other brands I've tried. I started using coconut milk years ago when I found out the incredible amount of water it takes to grow almonds. I was pleasantly surprised that brands like SO Delicious and Nature's Promise (stop and shop's organic brand) were pretty creamy and did not taste very much like coconut. (I don't really like the flavor). The switch was easy. Cut to a couple days ago. I open a new carton of whole foods 365 coconut milk which was at room temp since it's shelf stable before being opened. I didn't love the consistency right off the bat. It seemed very thin and was *already separating* just after being opened. That does not usually happen with other brands until it's been in the fridge for a week or more. So... Already I was suspicious. After opening, I stored it in the fridge, like you do. This morning I went to pour some info my coffee. I shook it up very vigorously in hopes it wouldn't seperate so badly. I poured some out and not only were there big chunks floating in my coffee, but the liquid that came out was basically clear. Very \"sheer\" if you will. I drank a little out of my mug and tried again after shaking the container some more. Clear. This legit looks like coconut water. Which is not what I want in my dairy substitute. It also has a pretty strong flavor of coconut which I really dislike. So... Now I'm stuck with half an opened carton, and another two cartons that haven't been opened yet. If you're after something to use as a milk substitute that has a nice creamy thickness to it... Spend the extra money and just go with So Delicious or another brand. This is NOT a milk substitute by any means and in my case it was a total waste of money. Read more"

What I like: There is WAY LESS sugar in it than in the other brand which I very much prefer.  I also like that it does not curdle in my coffee.  I also like that it is shelf safe with a long life expectancy. What I do not like: The product is thin, more like milk than coffee creamer and because of this I have to use about 3 times as much product to get it to be as white as I like my coffee.  Since this is the case, it cools and dilutes the coffee quite a lot.  Also it means that I need to use a lot of product and therefore it is I estimate 3 times more expensive to use than Silk. I would love a thicker more cream like product with the same flavour profile and also quality of not curdling. Read more"

And for cereal, but other vegan mills didn‚Äôt cut it. I actually enjoy eating cereal again bc of this brand. I buy the regular unsweetened almond for normal things, this flavor for the cereal. Now I see a creamer (maybe more, but Cookie Butter DELICIOUS) and some extra creamy which I bought but haven‚Äôt yet tried. I LOVE this brand and very brand loyal when they meet certain requirements.

These little cartons of soymilk are a perfect portable way to deliver a quick 20g of carbs when he tests low. They are handy when we are out at sports, boy scouts, etc. If your loves ones have food allergies, you'll appreciate that they are free of dairy, lactose, gluten, casein, egg and MSG. (I wish they didn't contain carageenan). Unlike juice which is pure sugar, these contain 5g of protein so they aren't as bad a spike to blood sugar. The aseptic packs don't require refrigeration, and they store well. We keep 2 in our son's medicine bag to be used in times of hypoglycemia. They do taste best when cold. But for that particular situation, it's perfect. // If you value quality of food, read on. We try to buy organic when possible. Silk started out as all organic, but sold to Dean Foods. Most of their items are now conventional. They do certify as non GMO. But make no mistake, Dean Foods is more interested in profits than sustainable food practices. They spent approx $240million dollars to fight *against* GMO labeling in California. You won't find that on the side of the Silk cartons. For these reasons, we no longer purchase Silk unless we can't find better options. Read more"

They make traveling with children easy because there's always silk available. You just can't leave it in a hot car. Last year our BJ's location closed and with no other available sources nearby, we started ordering from Amazon's subscription service. The first shipment arrived just 3 days after ordering and was packaged just fine. The producers of Silk (Great Wave) have also been fantastic. After purchasing one of these Silk 18 packs from BJ's and discovering over time that some had \"curdled\" I contacted them with a friendly e-mail making them aware of the issue.

Apparently, this is not coffee creamer but you're supposed to be able to make foam out of it? Personally, I don't see how it's any different than other oat milks. In fact, it may even be a thinner version and less product? All I can say is don't AT ALL think you're going to get a creamer like taste or consistency out of this product. Better off getting more for your money by buying a normal size container of oat milk. Read more"

The mouthfeel and texture are better than almond milk, which I find can be too watery to work well as creamer. Since it's not sweetened, it works well in cooking (for example, we use it for clam chowder). I also like that it's shelf stable until opened. That makes it easier to store. Read more"

But they either have migraine triggers or change the flavor and texture of coffee in ways that I can never get used to. And then I found this product: Califia Barista Blend Oat Milk. The texture is smooth and creamy, the flavor does not overpower the coffee, and the ingredients list shows no migraine triggers. Because I like the oat creamer, I just tried the barista MUSHROOM OAT creamer from the same maker. I hated it. To make matters worse, I realized too late that the mushroom version contains nutritional yeast. So now I‚Äôm going back to the tried and true! Read more"

For example, I don't like chocolate ice cream at all, but I adore fudgsicles.  Anyway, I think Amazon's brand will be my new favorite. It should be especially delicious in warm weather because it is thirst quenching and very refreshing, wonderful over ice.  The Amazon brand products I've tried have consistent quality, and I've not been disappointed with any of them. You can't beat the prices, either. It's all good! Read more"

I use this for baking, for sauces, and mostly, to put on my morning cereal. Nuts, especially almonds, are good for us, when eaten in moderation, so I actually feel good about using this milk. I hated milk as a child, and most of the time, I just wouldn't drink it, much to my mother's dislike. Had I had almond milk, I would have probably downed all she gave me. Many almond milks are fortified with calcium, so if you have a child who hates cow's milk like I did, perhaps he or she will drink almond milk. It's worth a try. And, as an added bonus, almond milk won't give you the digestive upset that cow's milk can sometimes cause. Try it! I think you'll like it! And, you'll be doing your body a favor. Read more"

And, it has the same amount of protein and even more calcium.  It's great in cereal, coffee, tea, and dessert cocktails that usually call for cream.  I've even used it in pudding and mashed potatoes, as well as macaroni and cheese. The only time I find it gritty is when I haven't shaken it enough.  Although the Original - Unsweetened is my favorite, I stock up on these shelf-stable cartons for travel.  I do wish they would offer the unsweetened variety in these cartons, since we try to limit sugar.  But especially now, when we are trying to limit food shopping to once a month, these have been lifesavers.  As much as I appreciate these 8 ounce cartons when we travel, during this time of plague and pestilence, they're practically keeping us alive (please feel free to chuckle).  Thank you Ripple!

I've tried almond milk and soy milk from all of the most common grocery store brands and was never turned off from milk alternatives outright but none were ever good enough to get me to switch. Oatmilk--not just this chocolate variety--is good enough to get me to switch. Full stop. Where other milk alternatives taste and feel thin or hollow, oat milk is round, robust, and thick in just the right way that it achieves that milky quality. This chocolate oat milk went into a bowl of some Frosted Flakes and it was a revelation. Also, oat milk is just as healthy as other milk alternatives without all of the environmental damage, I'm looking at you, almond milk and your disproportionate use of freshwater. Read more"

I realized if you shake before opening, there‚Äôs no room inside the container to do this properly. Simply open, pour out a small amour into another container...put the cap back on & shake well.

I read you should always read the ingredient list & purchase the coconut milk with the least amount of ingredients.

I was so disappointed when I tried other non-dairy creamers until I met and fell in love with this creamer. Not only is it delicious, I feel so much better drinking this than I did drinking cream. I just know I'm doing good things for my body. I prefer this creamer to any others also because it has two ingredients - coconut cream + water. All the other crap that's in other creamers isn't good for our bodies. Read more"

        "reviewdata": "This is literally the tastiest, creamiest, and healthiest coconut milk I've tried. I had resorted to making my own coconut milk for the longest time because I'm sensitive to the traditional coconut milks sold in stores that have gums added to them and couldn't find any brand of coconut milk that didn't have gums added to their product. But the problem was that although making coconut milk is easy, it's time consuming and the milk spoils pretty fast. I was THRILLED when I heard about Thai Kitchen's Lite Coconut Milk that only has 2 ingredients: water and coconut, and immediately ordered this 6 pack from Amazon. The price for this coconut milk is phenomenal and actually, slightly less than buying them individually at your local supermarket. What wowed me more was the taste. I enjoy having a cup of this each night when I make my Golden Milk. If you haven't heard of Golden Milk, it's an anti-inflammatory drink, chock-full of antioxidants and other health benefits. Making my Golden Milk with Thai Kitchen's lite coconut milk makes the drink extremely creamy and comforting. The recipe is very simple for those who may be interested in trying it: 1 cup Thai Kitchen Lite Coconut Milk 1/2 tsp turmeric with black pepper (or add black pepper separately if your turmeric doesn't have it built in; the black pepper helps your body absorb the turmeric) 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon 1/4 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 1 tsp honey or sweetener of choice Add to a small pot, warm over medium heat, pour, and enjoy! I hope that Thai Kitchen never stops making this coconut milk. I will be a customer for life! Read more"

I don't know how they do it. It's nice to get the 6 bottles and once and not to have to store them in the fridge. Super convenient to always have delicious coconut milk at hand.

        "reviewdata": "UPDATE: After a thorough shaking of a few cans, and refrigerating the contents in a glass bowl overnight, the product had separated once again into chips and water.  Now I find I can't return the remaining 20 (TWENTY) cans, or even one 12 pack of them. A complete waste of my money and time. Please don't buy: you WILL be disappointed!!!! I have ordered this brand before, and have enjoyed it a lot. The flavour and consistency has always been reliable, and top notch quality. So I ordered 24 cans. Unfortunately the product processing is now different, and seems the same  throughout the few cans I have opened so far. As you will know, if you've bought tinned coconut milk previously, the consistency is usually very viscous, and is most often a large blob of cream surrounded by very watery milk. In the summer, you can just shake the can for a while, and the cream/water will combine. In the winter, it takes some warming to get that to happen. The first indication that something was amiss, was that when the can was shaken, it was already very \"watery\" sounding, even before  warming...... As you can see, the cream is \"chips\" and they just sit in the water. The flavour is OK, but it's difficult to get the water/chips to recombine into the product into that I've come to expect from Thai Kitchen. Perhaps it's a new manufacturing technique in use, but it's really annoying: It looks as though the product has curdled, even though it tastes quite normal.  I'll be cancelling my subscription for this product. Read more"

I never realized that I wasn‚Äôt drinking any milk at all, until I started using another brand of unsweetened almond milk. It‚Äôs really convenient to be able to open my front door & have 6 boxes of almond milk there too! Couple of things I‚Äôve done & adore- I‚Äôve started dropping a stick of Cinnamon into a few boxes of my refrigerated almond milk. Yummm üòã I‚Äôm not a big coffee drinker, but have always had a deliciously icy, cold spot in my tummy for Coffee Ice Cream-Only the Best (Of Course) & created an alternative to Coffee Ice Cream! Some may find it to be a pain in their coffee, but I Love It! I start with a tall (10‚Äù tall glass) & fill it halfway w/ Unsweetened Almond Milk. Recently, it‚Äôs been Silk‚Äôs. Then, I literally pour in at least 2 Tablespoons of Medalio D‚ÄôOro‚Äôs Instant Expresso (If I don‚Äôt want the full caffeine tilt throttle bump, I add 1/2 Decaf (Any type you enjoy) & 1/2 Expresso) I add 1-2 teaspoons of ground Cinnamon & stir. If my sweet teeth are jonesing, (sp?) I add Honey or Raw Sugar to taste. Then, to give it that Ice Creamy Luxury Taste, I add either Whole Organic Milk, The Coconut (Canned) Milk & stir like a possessed soul! If I‚Äôm having a bad day or have forgotten to eat & just need some calories, I‚Äôll add a teeny bit of Organic Cream, but of course. Next, once I‚Äôve taken the time to put this all together, I‚Äôll go splay myself somewhere away from my Cell, Laptop & people. Particularly people, as once anyone tastes this, they‚Äôll try finishing mine or ask me to make 1 for them. Somehow, this always seems to happen just after I‚Äôve mixed it perfectly & have just allowed the 1st sip to infuse & begin to completely regenerate my soul, imagination & life-joy! Life‚Äôs gotten so crazy difficult & concurrently simple since COVID dropped onto our planet! Avoiding Iceland of course, brilliant lot of souls in Iceland. Can you even start to imagine how it would feel to See Everyone‚Äôs Entire Face, Everyday-With Zero Fear of Infection? Remember when ... Here‚Äôs hoping that you & your loved ones (2 & 4 legged & in between!) are all safe, healthy & continue to stay so, with a roof over your heads & good food in your bellies. I find it‚Äôs efficient to reuse Cinnamon Sticks, tho I keep the used, washed & dried ones in a separate Spice Bottle then the never used ones. The Sticks do expand in liquids, tho make great straws for Cider, Hot Cider, the warmed version of this Coffee Ice Cream & even in Hot Vanilla (Think Hot Chocolate w/out the Cocoa Powder, a bit of sliced vanilla bean (or vanilla  extract-needs must) & I‚Äôd imagine the Vanilla Almond Milk) w/ Honey laced Cinnamon Sticks-heated, not boiled late at night or after being outside in the cold. With the added benefit of serving with a red-bowed, snazzy Cinnamon Stick Stirrer, like Peppermint Candy Canes!) To reclaim my Cinnamon Sticks, I quickly tired of trying to get them back out of the Almond Milk Box hole, so I slash the topside of the empty container, extract the used Cinnamon Stick, wash it & either dry it or pinch it & put it back into a full container of Almond Milk, headed to the frig. If you enjoy Cinnamon, this is a treat. It‚Äôs a simple pleasure that makes life feel fun & grand for a moment! We Deserve Grand Again, even if just for a moment! Read more"

I spent 45 minutes spraying the outer box, opening it and removing each of the cartons of shelf stable milk and wiping them off, both any virus and the milk that ended up soaking both outer boxes within the delivery box, then rinsing off my porch and sidewalk! We, luckily, only lost one carton of the milk. I only know that the delivery showed USPS. Our mail appears to have been delivered at the same time. If this box was not leaking in the Postman's truck, then it was \"dropped\" onto our porch. That is unacceptable. They should have at least let us know. The doorbell was not rung either.

The reason I buy this nut milk as opposed to others is that this is the cheapest one for the bundle of six...if u wait for the price to go down lower on some days. The only issue is when using with soups to make creamy, as in potato soup, it gives a flavor of vanilla even tho I buy the unsweetened regular almond milk. What's the give there? It's not a deal breaker tho & I will continue to buy this item until the other nut milks go on sale or this one reaches their prices...and it prob will. Read more"

        "reviewdata": "I took a major risk on this product. Growing up, I was lactose intolerant. It turned me against milk. I have been using protein supplements for years and always mixed them in water. People would always say, \"Eww, water with a protein shake?\" It's not that bad, people. I had noticed that I have been getting worse about snacking on sweet foods. I honestly don't like sweet foods. But I was eating M&Ms, Almond Joy, Mounds, cake and was worried that I was letting myself get too into sweet foods. So, my daughter, who isn't lactose intolerant, loves almond milk. I tried some of hers with one of my protein shakes. I even let the shake sit in the freezer to make kind of a chocolate protein milkshake. It was good! It also didn't hurt me. For those people who try to convince lactose intolerant people of \"it won't hurt you\", please, understand that we've had hard lives! You all eat your ice cream and we paid triple for some frozen yogurt. We were even scared to eat macaroni and cheese. Milk to a lactose intolerant person is like poison. No offense to Almond Breeze. I have now drank two entire cases of this. I even got creative (bad idea) and tried the coconut almond with my chocolate protein shake, it was okay, but the unsweetened Almond Breeze is perfect in my Naked Nutrition chocolate protein shake. Oh and by the way, keep it away from the teenagers. They have no courtesy. They will drink a whole container and not put another one in the fridge. Probably the best compliment possible was from my son who is 13, he said, \"This milk is so good. It's my new favorite because I can drink the whole container.\" No clue that us parents pay for this stuff. Thinks I've got an almond cow outside. Seriously, really good product, I like the shelf-sustainability. We have a lot of food and drinks and everything else in the fridge, so I can just grab one and get it cold and make my 2 shakes for the day. Read more"

My order is always on time, it only takes an additional couple of days. If you live in California, you may get it faster, because Almond Breeze headquarters is in Sacramento. UPDATE: sadly, Amazon does not offer this item in their Subscribe & Save program anymore, but at the same time I should point out that Amazon still has the lowest price available anywhere, online and locally, plus, if you are a Prime member, you get free two day shipping or $3.99 one day shipping, so Amazon is still the best place to purchase this item from.

If I am lucky, they might have nondairy creamer for coffee.  But that is not milk. I thought about packing some Silk milk in a thermos and taking that along.  But I could not gauge just how much I would need and the thermos was a heavy nuisance. Then I discovered these little to go containers.  Perfect! I could pack one for each day away! My bag got lighter with each passing day, and though they don't have to be refrigerated unless opened, I was able to store them in the hotel room refrigerator just to put a little chill on them. They come in handy for other uses, too, work, lunches, picnics, etc.  Now that it is winter around here, I am  keeping some on the shelf in case I get snowed in.  These are supposedly available locally.  I have not seen them.  The taste is great (I like vanilla); the value for the money is excellent.

I was really pleasantly surprised to see that this milk has no grainy texture but in fact its super smooth and thick (probably due to the pea protein). In addition, this milk has all the omegas and all the amino acids. Again, super milk! This stuff is incredible!  I use it with protein powder and it takes great.

What about that screams creamer, I have no idea. But needless to say, this is NOT coffee creamer, it is plain almondmilk, which just happens to have a creamy consistency. Califia Farms has other products that are in fact advertised as creamers, please buy that. On to the actual product, it's wonderful. The taste is where it's at. It is smooth, and not grainy like many almondmilk's can be. However, I will say that the foaming capacity of the milk is not really there. I use a Nespresso foamer and it makes the tiniest amount of foam. So, this is great for just plain lattes or milk for cereal/oatmeal/whatever. Best part about this is the taste and the ingredients. They're as minimal as can be for typical almondmilk's. Read more"

To me, at least with my bottles, it comes across as a creamy melted shake taste, and I could easily decern the Vanilla and Coffee, but not the Almond milk which was totally fine, and not the Monk Fruit, so no weird aftertaste, so super fine!  lol Much better consistency (I think) than many similar products, not sicky sweet, nor loaded with sugar either, not at all like another brand I've purchased, and this one will be replacing. This is one of those you can dress up or dress down so to speak.  I've had it over ice, used it as a creamer (yum), blended it with a frozen Banana (super yum), over Overnight Oats, and I be you could use it as a tasty mixer as well. Read more"

I can drink coffee, espresso, etc., black, and I still love it, but many people enjoy it more with some creamer, and real, or artificial sweetener. I figured I would try this to have an almond milk alternative for company. That didn‚Äôt stop me from trying it. It actually tastes great. I don‚Äôt have a problem with milk products, and I have plenty of calcium in my diet, so is almond milk better for you?

I was delighted I could get it for a reasonable cost on Amazon's Subscribe & Save program for about $5 per carton, which while still not cheap, seemed reasonable.  Fast forward 6 months, and the price has shot up to $7 to $8 per carton, which is ridiculous, this isn't even organic.  I can find something better, or start making my own, for much less expensive than this.  If cost isn't an issue for you, then you will love this almond milk. Also, it doesn't have a super long shelf life, so you have to be able to drink it fairly quickly. Read more"

And yes it has a creaminess to it, they say theirs has more almonds than the other brands and I'm sure it does because it has more calories (130), total fat 11g, and protein 5g and the creaminess.  No not as thick as the other brands that have all the gums added to them.  But I really believe that all those gums are not healthy!  I buy unsweetened I have to watch my sugar intake and to me it tastes like Silk unsweetened.  I add a touch of stevia and then I avoid the added sugar----no matter what brand to me it tastes better with just a little bit of sweetness added to it.  And if you are wanting any brand of almond milk to taste like cows milk you will be disappointed, it is almond milk not cows milk.  I am very happy with this almond milk and the six were packaged in a carton from Elmhurst, and shipped inside another box so they arrived in good condition.  So I'm very pleased with my order!

No compromise on taste and the amount of almonds used gives it a delicious, creamy quality that I haven't found in other basic nut milks. And with just almonds and water and not all the fillers of other brands, I know what I'm putting in my body and that goes a long way. Shipping was great, the exp dates are in 2020 so at least 6 months out, packaging was flawless, which I'm all pleased about. The price is the kicker. It was late when I went to make this purchase and for some godforsaken reason I thought this was a 12 pack. I buy the cartons for $5 at my local grocery store and wanted a cheaper alternative so when I did the (incorrect) math and thought I'd be saving 10 bucks, I ordered immediately. Don't order when you're tired! The price feels like some sort of health food extortion... If you don't want to put garbage in your body you better pay the price.... 8 bucks a carton is insanity and I will never purchase this off of Amazon again. Even Walmart sells a 6 pack for $35,so I will be going back to buying a couple cartons a week for ten bucks from my local store and can only be thankful I used a gift card to purchase this outragous and straight-up offensively overpriced milk from Amazon...

This cashew milk is of superb quality; it is made with only 2 ingredients (non-GMO cashews and water), and has no added sweeteners or thickeners.  I rely on every single day (that I'm home anyway) for morning smoothies and my bowl of cereal.  It works great in coffee too. Another thing that is nice about this cashew milk is that it can be stored without refrigeration until opened.  I'll buy a case or two at a time and then keep them in my kitchen cabinet until I need to open a new bottle. The company also makes other plant-based milks, most of which I have tried.  The 2nd best one is the walnut milk (also creamy, just a different flavor and more fat content).  I also buy the hazelnut milk every so often (it's a little more watery than these other 2).  Elmhurst also makes almond and oat milk (have not tried the oat milk yet). Yes these Elmhurst milks are pricey and I do go through bottles quickly, but for me this is worth every penny.  I've not found a plant-based milk of this quality anywhere - and I've tried - and it's a lot of trouble to make your own.  It can also be also expensive to make your own if you use good quality nuts, because you need to use a lot to make a milk as creamy as this.  So you can try to make your own and see how the cost and effort compares.  I've tried and think this is worth it and heartily recommend these Elmhurst milks, especially the cashew and walnut milks.

I use mine primarily to pour over my oatmeal (Im also gluten and sugar free). They must have redesigned the cap (as I know some earlier reviewers talked about poor cap design) because I got no leakage.

We have tried a lot of substitutes, as we like a milk-like product to use in cereal and coffee and for cooking.  This Rice Dream Vanilla has a wonderful taste and works well with cereal.  It doesn't taste like rice to me.  I love that you can keep extra cartons on the shelf and order it infrequently.  Only the open box needs to be refrigerated, and shelf life is very long.  When I cook with Rice Dream I have to keep in mind that this particular product has some sweetness and a slight vanilla flavor.  That is a plus when I'm baking, and I can actually cut back on the sugar in recipes, but I cannot use it in a savory sauce where I don't want any sweetness.  Otherwise, it cooks well and can be substituted ounce for ounce for milk. Read more"

I was worried it would taste like rice like some other reviewer mentioned, but it didn't. Used for cereal.

Not that is the same as milk so don't have that expectation.  It's different but definitely share similarities.  It's \"thick/creamy\" and has a mild flavor so works well with other ingredients, as does milk. Anyway, I highly recommend this as a milk alternative.  Almond milk IME is more watery.  Preferred the taste of almond over cashew.  Oat is OK but too much carbs IIRC.  I avoid soy milk.  But I prefer pea over almond (my choice for awhile now)!  Especially considering Ripple is low carb (unsweetened version), has a good amount of protein too! and also has a much lower water index.  I'm trying my best to be mindful of the products that I purchase and their impact on the environment. Read more"

Plus it has 8 grams of protein just like milk does, so it is nutritious and satisfying.

I am a cereal lover and found that their Ripple unsweetened vanilla-flavored pea milk is delicious, a terrific addition to my daily cereal routine. I love the taste, and it is a healthier alternative to regular daily milk. In addition, it reduces my carbon footprint and uses less sugar.  than dairy or almond milk. Brings eight grams of protein per serving, zero sugar, 50% more calcium than milk, and adds 32MG of DHA Omega 3s. One more element of Ripple is a hugely positive one for me, and that is that their product lasts longer, carrying a \"Good By\" date that is two to three months long, which is huge for someone who is on the go a lot. Plus, it is cost-effective also. It is so great to be able to order Ripple via Whole Foods and Amazon Prime, as I get it delivered to my home whenever I need a new supply. Read more"

I don‚Äôt like the taste of dairy milk and almond and soy don‚Äôt feel good (it sounds weird I know) so I thought I‚Äôd give this one a try. I work on my feet all day for about 7-12 hours and drinking a glass in the morning helps me wake up. It has also helped my calves from not getting Charlie horses. So far I‚Äôve drunk two cartons in four days. It‚Äôs just that good. It reminds me of a banana smoothie or milkshake minus the added sugar. I definitely recommend it to any banana flavor lover out there. Read more"

About a year ago they added some new flavoring? or way of processing the refrigerated type which gives it a somewhat rotten or spoiled taste.  I wrote to them about it but only received a canned response.  Don't know if they really care what their customers think.  Anyway, I continue to buy the quart non-refrigerated type (until opened), as they have not ruined the taste of it as of now (even though it is more expensive than the refrigerated cartons).  If you find the flavor has changed in the refrigerated flavors (even the organic one) write to them and maybe if they get enough complaints, they will take it back to the original taste.  It always amazes me how companies take a perfectly good product and think they have to improve it with the end result being worse. Read more"

The taste is great, and I feel better because it offers more than regular milk as far as nutrients go for my son.  The flavor quickly turned into something I crave when I want a little something chocolate.  Another benefit is the lack of \"soy taste\" you get from regular soy milk. As far as the 32oz packaging....it is perfect for a weeks worth of drinking.  I don't have to worry about keeping more than one of these nice-sized boxes in the fridge, and it's nice not having to keep the rest refrigerated because it will never \"go bad\" as long as the seal isn't broken. My wife also likes adding a shot of this to her coffee because it gives it a nice almond/chocolate flavor and is MUCH better for her than regular flavored creamers. I will definitely be buying more when I get low. Read more"

They have gotten better over the years but, are not the greatest. Also, too much soy in the diet really messes with the thyroid. If you have any health issues, your thyroid will get hit even sooner on a heavy soy diet. I had to learn this the hard way. I have tried other milk substitutes: rice, hemp, coconut; all were either too high in sugar, too heavy, didn't work well in cooking or baking, didn't taste good, too expensive or all of the above. This unsweetened Almond milk, chocolate or plain, is delicious! I've used it in lattes, baking, cooking and even drinking it straight and I love it. It's smooth, light tasting and doesn't leave that after-taste that many soy drinks have. I have even given this to people who didn't know it wasn't real milk and they didn't notice the difference. AND, it is very reasonably priced. It fits right in with the soy milks and cow milks as far as price goes. I would strongly recommend this product. NOTE: If you are a full fat milk drinker - this might taste more like 2% or skim milk to you. Read more"

I add it to my coffee and use it on an occasional bowl of muesli. I've even just heated a mug of it as a warm cocoa drink a few times when I'm with friends enjoying their sweet hot cocoa. Avoiding foods with dairy, added sugars, or sugar alcohols isn't always easy for me. This product really helps! I find the consistency of this to be comparable to other nut milks without a lot of thickener in them. I never liked the consistency of milk with fat in it. I liked skim milk only. Now that I'm used to nut milks, and prefer the ones that don't have a lot of thickener/gums in them, I find the consistency of this one to be just fine. Read more"

We love non-dairy milks, so we've had soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, and cashew milk; and this oat milk has a creamy flavor and is especially great with savory foods, because it's not too sweet (this \"plain\" flavor).  However, blended with sugar, this works great in desserts too. This flavor (plain) is vegan too.  (We don't know about the other flavors.) This has become our staple non-dairy milk, because it's versatile enough for both sweet and savory foods. We each have different palates -- one of us can't taste any \"oatiness\" in this milk.  The other one can taste a faint \"oatiness\", very subtle, but enough to notice when this is drunk straight with no mixing.  So it'll depend on your individual palate.  If you hate oats even when they're in oatmeal cookies, you may not like this.  Otherwise, it's delicious! Read more"

We have tried all three flavors (original, vanilla and chocolate) and each is absolutely terrible. They taste like an extremely watered down beverage with a little bit of flavor add in-NOT like a plant milk. The issue is not that they aren't chocolatey enough or that the vanilla is subtle, its that they are SO watered down they taste like a bad flavor water. VERY disappointing considering they were likely trying to market these for kids lunches and most parents may not realize how bad they taste and how lacking they are in nutrients. Read more"

A bit more expensive to order on Amazon - sometimes the price goes as high as $26! Once it dips below $20 I order these packs for our office. They make a perfect alternative to milk. Can be used in cereal, coffee, oatmeal, protein shakes - the list goes on. I also use almond milk (vanilla works fine and you cannot taste it after cooked) to make vegan breading. A bowl of almond milk + arrowroot powder or corn starch to thicken makes a great alternative to egg. My breaded eggplant comes out crispy and delicious! Read more"

        "reviewdata": "Actually cheaper than the boxed kind, if you do the math right (see below). Amazing product, if you understand what you‚Äôre getting. Typical almond milk, even homemade, is more like a ‚Äútea‚Äù of almonds - in the store it has additives to make it smoother and more shelf stable, and to add calcium etc. This is whole, finely ground almonds, period. The milk therefore has more nutrition - aka calories - per cup. Boxed almond milk has what, 35-50 calories per cup, while Joi has close to 200. We‚Äôve been programmed to think low calories is healthy, but the way I see it is, boxed almond milk is buying a bunch of water and chemicals with a dash of almond. Joi is, again, whole blanched almonds. If you compare the cost per cup, yes Joi seems expensive. But if you water Joi down so it has an equal amount of calories or almond content as the boxed, Joi is far far ***less*** expensive than boxed. A cup of Joi has a lot of beneficial nutrients, while boxed almond milk is mostly filler and homemade usually involves throwing a lot of the almond away after the liquid is extracted. Now that we know fat isn‚Äôt evil (we do, right?), we can see Joi is an actual whole food. Yes you need to keep an eye on the portion size if you‚Äôre concerned about weight gain, but again - it‚Äôs a real food. My housemate makes homemade almond milk which has similar settling, but is much less creamy and flavorful, and more expensive when you consider dollars per nutrient. Also less ecologically sound, as so much of the almond gets thrown away. I was delighted to find this foams as nicely as cow milk in the espresso machine - even delicate micro foam! Not always, I‚Äôm still figuring out why it sometimes doesn‚Äôt. Yes there is a little grit but that happens in homemade too. It doesn‚Äôt happen in boxed not because boxed is innately better, but because boxed is a totally different product. Read more"

I like the idea that it is only almonds with no fillers or anything else and that is has more of the nutrition and good fats than regular refrigerated almond milk has.  It does separate just like natural nut butters and needs to be stirred before measuring and using it.  I mix it in my ninja blender cup and it works great.  It always mixes smooth with no lumps.  It tastes like almonds and works great in my coffee and smoothies.  The only thing I don't really like is the container that it comes in.  The lid has to be pushed down hard to close it tightly and there always seems to be oil leaking out of the edge.  I do really like this product and will probably purchase it again.  It's not as convenient as refrigerated almond milk, but I do think it's healthier and the fact that the base doesn't need to be refrigerated is great. 8/12  I'm updating my review to 3 stars instead of 4 because I really don't like the container it is in.  I lifted it up after not using it for a week or so and there was a large ring of oil all over where it was sitting and the container was very oily.  I'm hoping it didn't ruin the toaster oven.  This needs a jar with a screw lid to keep all the oil in.  It's a great product, but the container needs rethinking. 10/9 Updating my review back up.  The company reached out to me about the lid issue and sent me a new container with a new screw on lid to try out.  It's perfect and no more leaking.  Plus customer service is excellent.  The only negative that I've seen is the new container is one ounce less than the old one, but I'm assuming this is because of the cost of the new lid and container design and it won't stop me from purchasing it.  Overall I'm very happy with this product. Read more"

My last review was hard to write because I wanted to love JOI, and the first encounter with it left me thinking, 'Why is this just a flat, lifeless, diluted glass of chalk water?!' My review was brutally honest that this just wasn't the best way to experience joy. Fast forward to just a few seasons later, and I get a second chance to try the new and improved JOI. Guess what? My first review needs an update! This new JOI is creamier and a great alternative to homemade or store-bought when in a pinch, on a journey, or simply lacking refrigeration. I recommend using a lot of JOI with \"better\" water to get a more satisfying thickness, adding a dash of salt or vanilla to your taste for flavor improvement, and blending it for a solid 5 minutes to incorporate everything into a smooth finish. Ultimately, this new version is worth trying (especially the cashew), and I am happy to share the news that this might just bring you joy. ---------------------- OLD REVIEW Such a great idea, but somehow failed execution. December 12, 2019 I wanted to like this so much. I love JOI's advertising and the concept of having a nut base on hand to quickly mix with water and go. And, as a branding person, their imagery and expressive nature are to be celebrated. I mean, \"Add JOI\" and \"Made with JOI,\" how does that not make your heart feel happy? Unfortunately, the flavor is weak, if non-existent. This nut base mix -- though initially appearing like it could be a nut butter who deserves to be nut milk -- is not even relatable to any almond milk you would buy at a store, and it's a whole other galaxy away from making your own at home. The disappointment is palpable. When you mix this into your glass, you won't get the anticipated sweetness of almond, nor the rich, creamy goodness of the oil fats and the proteins swirling unhindered in your cup. No. Instead, you will get a flat, lifeless, diluted glass of chalk water. For the same price, you can soak some gorgeous almonds of your choice overnight in the fridge in imported water from New Zealand, blend them up in the morning, run them through a mesh strainer, and have 1 - 2 gallons of homemade almond milk to live off of for the next week or two. Need some stored away for a rainy day? You can freeze some of your creation as a concentrate. When ready, toss some into a pitcher with water to defrost in the fridge whenever you want. All of this to say, there are better ways to spend your money that will bring you more joy. Read more"

And we usually purchase silk vanilla or chocolate, but since those are sweet and silk doesn't offer plain flavor in 8oz size, I decided to give this brand/item a try seeing that it's made in usa. And they got delivered pretty fast which is good, but the expiration date was pretty short, and not sure if that was the reason why, but there were a lot of thick soy powder separated from liquid just staying at the bottom of the package which resulted in yucky texture 'every time' we tried one. And the package does mention to 'shake well' and we sure did, but it still didn't help, which never happened with silk brand.. so I'm assuming it's been either sitting on the shelf too long or it has to do with technical issues at the manufacturer, or is purposefully skipping an emulsifier to keep product more natural? I don't know... Read more"

According to the label on the box: Serving size 1 cup is only 45 calories, 3.5 g fat (0 saturated fat), 0 cholesterol and only 3 total carbs (0 sugar carbs) so you just can't beat it unless you want to just drink water all day. 2. I drink an EGG chocolate protein shake (only a couple calories and carbs) every morning and this tastes the absolute best mixed with the powder shake. I also add a little Sweetleaf all Natural liquid Sweetener (which is 0 calories and 0 carbs), sweetener is much needed and instantly have a great tasting power drink to keep me full until lunch. 3.This chocolate almond drink is also good blended in the \"Bullet\" with ice and again must put in the Sweetleaf sweetener and it's very refreshing. Sometimes I add a bannana to it. Yum! I am planning on ordering from Amazon the Sweetleaf chocolate all natural sweetener. I know it will be delicious with this chocolate almond milk too. The \"sweetened\" chocolate almond milk is to die for but then again, it's full of calories and carbs so for anyone watching their calorie intake or carb intake this is the one to order (as long as you add the Sweetleaf natural sweetener).

Personally, I am not a milk drinker, but tried this as hot chocolate; for me, it was not appealing but then again, I am more worried about her as she is only 3 and need nutrition as she grows. If I can get her to drink something healthy that she loves without the worry of fattening her up with chocolate, then I will and this Silk Soy Milk meets all expectations.

Seriously, it tastes even better than most of artificially flavored, unhealthy chocolate milks out there (like Yoohoo). The chocolate taste does cover up virtually all of the almond taste. If you are looking for a dairy milk substitute, look no further. This is even healthier than dairy milk--no saturated fat, cholesterol free, no lactose in case you're allergic, 45% Vitamin E, 25% Vitamin C, and 50% more calcium than dairy milk has. Read more"

The Salt and Sea candle is incredible. I left it burning for about 10 hours yesterday, and I lit it again the moment I got up this morning.

Manufactured in October '15 and about to expire in May '16, was sent to me in the 2nd last week of April '16. I am very particular about matters that can affect my health. Such things will never go unnoticed by me in ordinary circumstances. I hope they do not repeat this since I am definitely reordering this product now. It tastes good and I love to have my oats and cereals with it every morning. Read more"

As she got closer to 1 year, we tried to transition her to cows milk without any luck. The pediatrician recommended transitioning her to almond milk for now. As much as we are out and about, the 1/2 gallons were not very convenient. I found a 6 pack of these at Sprouts. When we got close to being out, I went on a hunt for more. Apparently in a town of 250k+, the only store that carries the 8oz singles is Sprouts. We live 30 minutes out, so I got on Amazon to see what they had. Boy was I happy about finding these here for a good price! Amazon and the Silk Almond milk singles has made out life so much easier! Read more"

So this is my alternate choice, but I quickly indulge by putting about 2 teaspoons original vanilla into it and it bursts with flavor and it is ultra delicious.  I love Almond Breeze and I will continue to drink Almond milk which is far better than cow's milk for the body.  I am extremely grateful for the availability of alternative milk choices and particularly Almond Milk. Read more"
