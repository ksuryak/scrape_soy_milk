# scrape_soy_milk

This project helps to get the soy milk details from Amazon webpages.

1) There are two yml files, through which the scraping is performed.
2) Initially, only the product information like the title, price, rating are scraped along with the product urls.
3) A sequential yml that is the soymilk_attr.yml fetches the product details in depth.
